Cameron.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
No...
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Is he oily or dry?
Hopefully.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
What?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
That's what I just said
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
No fear.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Oh, right.  Friday.
And why would I do that?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
Why, don't you?
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
This.
Who?
I dazzled him with my wit
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
The duck?
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No what?
Why not?
Oh huh
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Why can't we agree on this?
No, Daddy.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
What's to discuss?
See you next week!
But -- who -- what --?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I'm not bargaining!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Colon!  Don't!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Give me absolution.
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
God be with us admiral.
Twenty eight.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're lost!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Yes, Your Majesty.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
You bring the cigarettes?
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What's your cut?  How much?
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Yes, but he was a cop.
I will if they don't send me back.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
Pouring it out!
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Who do you think, Chief?!
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
I don't even watch TV.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
What's your accomplishment.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Could be Leon's.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.
Don't be late.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
Okay.  You ready?
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Where's Czech girl?
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
In here, says he wants a million.
Yes.  Both.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
What are you doing here?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
A cheap hotel.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
How did you start the fire this time?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
How long they been livin' here?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Not good.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Okay, come on down.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Roger.
He's got a point.
What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
I see.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Certainly.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
I see.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I will if I can, Frank.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true
Roger.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
I ain't tired yet.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
He's after your money.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
I'll keep it in mind.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
What do you want?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Can't complain.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
You know exactly where they are!
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
And then?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
You little sleaze bag!
Crystal.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Why not?
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
It's difficult.
I told you not to read all that crap!
Exactly.
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
Perfect, Mr. President.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Amen..
...I can't wait to be among you.
Okay, I believe you.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
... What's going on?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
I don't know what to say
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
A fellow investor.
Is it?
And they are?
If it's not him, there's no deal.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
They should be here any minute.
Sure.
We do.
Why don't they come to me?
I'm not so sure about this.
It's good what you're doing.
Who is this.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Because we're going there.
You enjoy it?
Show me.
I'm listening.
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
I'll risk it.
I'm not a cop.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Child pornography.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A daughter.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
I had to ask.  I apologize.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
It's been six years.
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Okay.  Fine.
I don't want to.
What?
Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
We have matching luggage.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Enough of that crap.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
What?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
He's inside you, where he hides.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Sobering...
Now.
Had kind of a long night.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Then we'll find another way.
Meaning?
No shit.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Makes you look like a nun--
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
I guess.
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
What about down?
I...don't know!
Anything ---
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Huh?
Take a look.
Thirty-four seconds!
- for horrors like yourself?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Thank you.
I'll be another!
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
No. Black.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Where'd you get the blood?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Do what?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
It's pretty old.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
You and Mel Gordon?
It's just...
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
What way?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
There's a furnace.
When did she die?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
He got his deer yet?
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Love! I'm made of love!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about her?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
That it wasn't an accident.
Money.
I don't know. You tell me.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Alice... I...
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
This doesn't make sense.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
How many others killed?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
We're not going to make it.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
I guess it depends on your perspective.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
What do you want with us?
My husband is a very courageous man.
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Over my dead body.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Can't it wait?
What?
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Excuse me?
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
Yes, sir.
Twenty-five years.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
What's the story?
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
I'd use the word insane.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Don't be too long.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
I don't want to hear that word!
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Huh?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
Would you go up, please?
I like my horizons narrow.
That's right.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
He didn't recognize me.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
And that fits?
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
When will Strader return?
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Ss-ai!
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
It is. 
Can't lock up...
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
It's insured.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
You tell me.  I only work here.
Sure, Hicks.
Aye-firmative.
Let's get these things lit.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
You're just reading me.
They're dead.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
No, it's different, honey.
Look!
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Is there a part for me?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
And how will you make him keep it?
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Where?
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Yes!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Why?
I can't write it!
Madame. How can I help you?
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
And I'm asking you -
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Do you hear him? Do you?
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Of course not.
Really?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Is she not here?
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
How many pupils do you have?
Pupils?
It's a secret.
Papa!
Yes, thank you, sir.
Why? What has happened?
So there you are. What do you say?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
My answer is no, Mozart.
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
But this is absurd!
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Do you have a daughter?
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
With all my heart, Mozart.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
What?
The man. He's here.
Strange!
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Do you have it?
What for?
Certainly, Herr Director.
On the contrary.
Mozart -
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Ballet? What ballet?
Well done, Sire!
I agree, Baron.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
No, why?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
David?
It was a wolf.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Right.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
That's easy enough.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Not just a patient -- me.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
A werewolf?
Charming.
The bedroom.
But, David.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, let's go now.
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
No, but he was on the moors.
Plan?
Let's just keep walking.
Do you think it's a dog?
Walk away, Jack.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
I wanted to see you.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
I will not accept this! Now go away!
You don't have to say anything.
Hello.
Then you have some hot tea?
We'll find him, not to worry.
You here again? What do you want?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Yeah.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
All right, Jack, all right.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
You don't have to do nothing.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Thank you!
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, thank you.
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
I haven't any.
Why, I don't know.
Well, I—
But I haven't . . .
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
What'll we do?
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
All right.
Yes.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Yeah, swell.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Yes, sir.
What time did Matt Brown get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Was it twelve o'clock?
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Bought himself a pocketbook!
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
I swear --
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
He just lost his temper a little.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
The Army can hang him.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
What's going on?
She was European!
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Perfect, Cole.
Sorry.
Don't let it happen again.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Yep.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
Pass me some whisky.
This here is the Younger Gang!
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Ho-yah!
On account of we're robbing it.
I figure.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Hell of a war.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
You can shut up now.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
Jesse, we're outlaws.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Where will you find such a girl?
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Yes ma'am.
Last February?
Mmm.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Thank you.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
And the same age Web was. No.
You do that.
By burning down their homes?
Yes sir.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Yes, dear.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Oh God, just get it over with.
That's nice.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Do you take American Express?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
It's not that nice.
Do...what.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
But what about the past? Our past?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
No, he doesn't.
You saw the ad in the Times?
There was no ad in the Times.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
What?
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Oh really? That's great.
Just...say...no.
Yes, sir.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Can you bring Mr...
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Sorry. 
Patrick? Is that you?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
No. I'm okay.
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Not really.
Well, I could he wrong.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Suit yourself, I guess.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Yes.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
You don't wanna move, do you?
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Didn't you visit the campus?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I know, I know.
I can't just walk away!
Milo --
It's gonna get cold.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
I am. I am, sir.
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
Oh. Yeah.
You've been coming in early.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
'Have a look?
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Gary?
I mean, it's your life.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
...Were you?
...Something like that. Yeah.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
The Day Care?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
What? Come on. Is it serious?
Yeah, yeah.
Where is he?
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
You may.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Kiss me.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
Thanks.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
My wedding tackle.
Sure.
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
Here, use mine.
Why?
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Don't worry!
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Kiss me.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Sure.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Where did you learn to shoot?
What are you saying, son?
Dr. Evil?
In due time.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
What did you say?
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
And how do you feel about that?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
... power ...
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Then you can't come in.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
People, too.
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Looks like rain, Steed...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
'Our revels now are ended.'
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Then what's stopping you?
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Yes indeed. I need protection.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
No thanks.
June, July ... August?
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Did he say who?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
No trouble.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
You don't trust me?
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Still a bit chilly ...
Not quite.
Pity your mother came, too ...
Decontamination -- ?
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Who's now vanished.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Getting to what?
So you say ...
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
That's not playing by the rules.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
So does Debbie.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
It looks awful.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Why don't you get undressed.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
You're on.
A real turd.
Any time, Al.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Right.
Really?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Right in there, pal.
That's the old Rick!
I'm saved. Let's party!
Who?
What's with her costume?
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
I don't know.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
-- Never mind.
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Brian, look --
-- What were they doing there?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
You think that's really any of your business?
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Got anything to drink in there?
Homey.
Uh huh.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
You could check. It'd be in his files.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Trychticholorate.
Glass?
-- Another backdraft.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
What?
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
No.
Yeah.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Four months?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Swayzak's not my boss.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
I was ahead of my time.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
Here we go...
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
Didn't think you'd make it.
I need to get in the trunk.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
Who?
"The Strawberries"?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Let me think about it.
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
You might be right.
Why are you smiling so?
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Must be the pressure.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
And I'm the feet.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
To what?
Mantan!!
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
I'm telling you it's not.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Sounds risky to me.
You getting cold feet?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
The big one.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
How so?
That's why it will be so much fun.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
I feel fine.
You sound like the media.
In time.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
I can't go all the way down south.
What's a Negro.
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
...too late, maybe around...
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
Enough.
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
We can look out for ourselves.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
As you please.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
It is my only object.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
All the same, you must name an amount.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Good night, my little darling.
Yes, papa.
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
HEY!
We found him like this...
I'm not telling you what happened.
You saved Kendall's life --
We've found all of them.
Your weapons, Sergeant.
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
So did we. Why didn't you come?
I...
Just look. Little pocket.
You're lying --
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
From up close or far away?
They?
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
What happened to "degrees"?
Mr. Hardy?
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
Because I was standing next to him.
And the problem is you only got three.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
What the hell are you talking about --
What are you talking about?
I wanted to see if he was okay --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Move him.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Something like that. You?
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
I plan to grow on you.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
Let's go talk to Bill...
You wanted to get the truth.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
What are you talking about?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Wait --
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
It's too neat.
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Thank you.
Yes.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
I brought it.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Eighteen.
It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
I can get it. I can just...
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
Okay.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
What did he say?
Really.
Dad!
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
There's over eighty thousand here.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You're asking for my documents?
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
What? What does he want?
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
What's wrong?
You don't understand anything.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What?
I don't want to talk about him.
It's none of your business.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
He will come back.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Okay we won't talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
So now you hate all women?
You...
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Well what have you got?
No.
It's alright.
No. What? No. I know.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Cash.
Well. It's good to see you.
You take her to a doctor?
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
I need ya help again.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
I do. God's truth. I do.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
I keep the heat on.
Let go of my arm...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Wait. He left.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Whose doin' is that?
Uh-uh.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
Anything.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Maybe I won't.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Yes'sir.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
What's on your mind?
Hey.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Got in a little accident.
Yeah.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Charlie...
-- I should tear your head off.
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Saving your life.
Let's grab some food.
I hope not.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Cool?
What does Charlie mean?
If you give me one.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
Yeah...
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Let's go.  Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
No.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Luck.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
What do you chant?
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
What if I chant?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I don't have to.
If he won't cooperate?
And what can he do for you?
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Where do we start?
You start.
Okay, but...
Sorry, don't have the time.
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
What if you change your mind?
Too old.
But if you could?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Are you for real?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
You mean the snake.
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
Ugh.
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
What's a long time?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Holden got hit.
Black?
Go ahead.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Oh.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Do ya?
No, I'm lost.
You're lost?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
You don't?
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Perry?
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Okay!  Damn!
Thank-Q!
Cross my heart and hope to die.
What?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
What's the pay?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
It does?
One who's not a mutant.
Stop that ma'am crap!
I like it.
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Wow.
Sure.
So, what are you seeing?
That's boring!
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
I certainly do!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
I like her.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Goodnight!
Neat. Goodnight!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
...I do.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
How do I leave here?
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
That's what everybody believes?
Yes, sir. It's true.
Uh, I think they have.
Russia.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
Why not? He has great pants.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Oh. I see.
Does that work?
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
I don't see anything!
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Yes, ma'am.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
All our friends...
I'm not hungry.
Why?
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
To bed.
Yes, you do!
What?!!
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
What?!
And if we can't find him?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Yeah! That's thinking.
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Yes.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
No, not at all.
Yes sir.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Well.
No, please. I won't.
I, uh.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Falling.
Does that scare you?
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
Just get outta my bed.
I'm glad you do.
It's okay. It's okay.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Frank?
Yes, but.
Okay Frank.
What?
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Alright.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Yeah. okay.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
That's too bad.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Maybe so.
Where are they?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Why not?
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Did you see her undressed?
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Oh yeah?
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
NO.
Dorothy Vallens?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
You can change it if you want to.
Stop it Mike.
Up where?
Yes.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
We're here brother.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Right.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
Pee...Per...Man.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
What are you serious?
You sure you killed them?
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Well, I'm sold.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
I mean he ain't here.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Yes.
Dignan, it's --
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Why not?
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll say it.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Right here.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Don't panic, Anthony.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
She needed it.
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
He seems pretty good.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Careful. Check his pulse.
What?
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I'm not kidding.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
That's a sharp jacket.
Grammar.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
How'd he do?
Death.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Is that OK?
Sixty days?
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Sure.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
God, yes. Like silk.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
True.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Good question.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
This is natural.
I don't know.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
See you in a little while.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I don't know.
This could be a trap.
You don't even know his name.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Now!
And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Who? Applejack?
Can't get it. It won't... 
Where's that guy going?
Got a little lucky.
Right.
And the Landy woman?
Bourne comes here? Why?
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.
It was staged?
Keep going...
Show me again...
That's not what happened to your parents.
Because you're afraid!
He's dead.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
It's just a nightmare.
I should be better by now.
Where --
What?
You hear me? I believed you.
A Russian?
No. You never worked Berlin.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Careful...
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Some women like Dobermans --
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Felt promising. It's a start.
And what about you, anything?
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
How many?
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
You scare me.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Tonight then.
How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
They've tricked us.
Anything.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
I... I don't remember.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
I thought you were a December baby.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
I know, but...
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
So it didn't feel... weird?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
What do you mean?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
I get it. You can drop it now.
Why's that?
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
Which is?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
...yes.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Me neither.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Wow... read something.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Huh?
Sorry. Never heard of her.
I came with Captain Renault.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
A champagne cocktail, please.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
I won't.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
Come up here a minute.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we do.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
Occupied France?
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Looking for a job.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Goodnight.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Apparently he has the letters.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
He suggested I ask you.
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
-- Is what?
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, rather.
Yes, I get the point.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
May we proceed with the business?
Are you quite finished with us?
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
What else, my dear Major?
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Good evening, Captain.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Mademoiselle.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
But I have no excuse to close it.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
He'll take one.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Well, she isn't just any woman.
Oh, thanks.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put that phone down!
Put it down!
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I like it fine here.
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
No.
Survive today, that's the point.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Then we've just got shit.
They're harder to do than they look.
He's your cute thing.
And for you --
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
My epitaph.
Great.  Really.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
Mom, meet Jango.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
But I might not have.
For the third time.
Forty-three days.
That's what it's about.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Deep, real deep.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was!
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
I've never seen a lobster.
Burma!
Oh...
I understand.
"King Kong". It's really good.
At least you were never lonely.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
"...did." Well, okay.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
Well, they aren't.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
Did you know your mother better?
Is that soon?
Where are you going?
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
It's all very normal.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Is it true?
She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Of course.
Right.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
What you got a picture of your heart for?
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
What view?
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
There'll be red flags.
That's not a bad place to start.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
You're a superstitious fucker.
I was doing it for them.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
It's not true.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
Two million.
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
I have a good crew.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
I need you to stake me.
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
Very much so.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Help me.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
What do I have to do?
I'll worry about Customs.
Why?
Lighten up.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
It's more than that.
How do you know I will?
Don't ruin this for me.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
No, I want my cut!
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
No, I want my cut!
You sure we're clear?
I'm getting a ride.
I'm sorry.
Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Pretty much.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
I can handle it.
Confidence. It's just confidence.
To who?
It's just insurance.
What are you talking about?
I don't know anything about it.
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
I'm working on that soccer story.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
And your lady?
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
I've got something to tell you.
I start Monday week.
I don't know.
Are you drunk?
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
I hope it brings you luck.
Never. Why do you ask?
You're already alone.
I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
Well, thank you anyway.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
Absolutely not.
Just an accident. Nothing.
That's fine.
Then you're not a pro.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Thank you.
Do you?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
How are you?
Who did it? Tell me!
I might.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
That bitch? No.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
I put them on together.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
They've been tested.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
Very impressive.
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
Why don't you have more time?
To explode, of course.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Fred.
Who cares?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Sorry.
Phenomenology...
Yeah, sure, I understand.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
Leave.  Now.
You're not still pissed?
Don't look down.
Later.
Am I?
SHHH!  Don't do that!
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Too early to tell.
I'm not a half bad cook.
It was open.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
How do I know you didn't?
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
Yes on all counts.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
The other ones?
A girl.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
Any idea when she'll be back?
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
You did.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Here's your money.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying.
A long time.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
It's a secret.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Pull the cash.
You get it when I get her.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
What happens if you level with her?
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
I'll give it my best shot.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You don't.
Easy Sketchy.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
True, but--
Say the words, "I understand."
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Gin.
Pick a song, Hawk.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
What's it worth to you?
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Damn straight we are.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
DUDES!
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Nah. Couldn't be.
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
The easy way.
Hawk?
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
What's gone?
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Good MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Where did you come from?
You have a request?
We never would have had this conversation.
That was a compliment.
Why?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Well...
Are you okay?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
The whole movie. Let's go.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
No. Frank.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
When did you stop taking your medication?
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Frank.
I think he saved my life.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
What about your family, Donnie?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
A sign from whom?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
The good stuff.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
If God exists?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
How did you know --
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Go back to China, bitch!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Yeah, you betcha...
Okay.
I gotta work with these women.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
Yah?
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
That's it, I'm goin'...
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
And the bite marks on my ears?
All right, they're makin' a movie.
My dress'll reek.
That's right.
Mm-hm.
What?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
The king can do no wrong! 
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Anything else? 
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
No... it was a seven letter word.
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
This is terrible!
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
I've always thought that myself.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Do you?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Did you see it?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He fell.  He falls.
Yes sir.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
I could easily arrange...
Do you think they'll go along with us?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Alas, no.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Oh no?
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Say "Mmmerrick."
The hospital?
Not at all, John.
Here.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
No, he's very upset about something.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Yes sir.  What's that?
A dressing bag.
A dressing bag?
HE'S GONE!
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
We never went to bed together.
Who?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Then let go!
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
But you don't want to hear it.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
You're just saying that.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Why?
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Shut up.
About NOT raping you...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
Why... should YOU care?
He was lucky...  Sit there.
It saved my father!
I know!
Don't you FEEL it?
What?
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Trust me to get the missionary.
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
To the oars!
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
What is it?
I was sitting there.
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Mum! Dad!
Hang on...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Can't make enough axe-heads!
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
I know, Dad.
No, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
Yeah.
Yeah, you told me that later.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Okay, I guess.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Wilmont. Near the high school.
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
You just say. I'm not really --
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Yeah? Oh, great!
I want to have a baby.
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Do you remember what we talked about?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
And I didn't have an argument.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Yeah?
Okay.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
I know.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Your dried cum.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Nah, I don't know.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Very cool. Trippy.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Listen, it's not erasing.
Hell no.
How did I look?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Yes?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
She came to help, Howard.
That's fine, Stan.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Maybe after the holidays then.
You can if you want.
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
So now you're bummin' around?
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Bonanza Jellybean?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Don't start with me, Cooper.
What?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
Does he know that?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
I built it.
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
Justin.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
...how's the client?
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
The date.
I don't know.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
One-four degrees...
Something like that, yeah.
Starck, give me a read.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
They're gone.
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Justin?
Come around to three-three-four...
Radiation interference?
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
No. It was someone else.
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Can you see a body?
Not according to the computer.
Do you know what it was?
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
And you can? Power it up?
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I had it at four.
This makes five.
Solid.
Got it, teach.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Go back to the drawing board.
That's terrible news...
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Great minds think alike.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Of course. Of course.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Susan. What are you doing?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Oh, I think you already have.
Skeptical...?
All right!!
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Why?
Sure. Come on in.
He's my friend, too.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
You first.
I know it's yours.
We've got to get an abortion?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Get going.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
Okay. See ya.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Yes.
How often do you go?
Totally.
He is.
I like sex.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
I know.
There's nothing to it.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Sometime?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
I couldn't make it in time.
How about your phone number?
The point sounds fine.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
What?
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Las Vegas.
Hell, no!
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
Damn right!
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
Can we make it?
What limes?
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
They'll be back.
Where is everyone?
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
With what just happened upstairs --
We're lucky to be alive.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Fuck you too.
What?
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Your brother, huh?
We lived near power lines.
Well...
Oh, no.
How much I got, what?
Four door?
Seven.
F-f-fuck you.
You smell like ass!
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Stop her!
Well...
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
'Forgive'...? For What?
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Thank you --
I'm not!
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Where's Clifford?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
I know, but --
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
You're under arrest.
What night?
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- 
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
Be careful, Francie.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Daddy!
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Are you really serious? About acting?
What about your husband?
Why, you... you little bastard!
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
You think I'd miss it?
Quietly.
What happened to him?
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Forget it.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
What for?
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
Will you marry me?
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Just a little way.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Yes.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Mama, what's...
You kill me, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Normal. Average.
What?
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
And he drove me to mine.
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
It can't be as bad as that.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
How did you find me?
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
It's been months. It's not like him.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
I wish to be your husband.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
How is it you come to be here?
My name is Frankenstein...
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
You're welcome.
Here we go.
Thanks.
Dancer.
Whatever you make yourself.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
That's thirty percent.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
I was a minister.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
What's in Mexico?
Whatsamatter?
You believe me don't cha?
Shut up and start the car.
He didn't recognize shit.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
What does that mean?
Or what?
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
Really?
He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
Don't say my name.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
I can make this wall without --
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
Last time I didn't.
Sure, sure.
Smoke it!
Maybe half.  Not even.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
You knew about us?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
Great. See ya then.
What?
You made a mistake.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Most people don't.
What else do you know about it?
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Who is he?
Can I use some?
I can't.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
You're fast.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
You go first! There's no time!
Nothing.
I heard something. A squeal.
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
You could order something in.
Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Brandon.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's okay. Listen-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
We'd never have the budget for this.
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
How did you come to that conclusion?
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
... What does that mean?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Where'd they go? Back inside?
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Mark 12.
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
We pretend...
Catch me later, okay?
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
As you wish.
But what if Sarris survives?
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Push It. Hold it down.
Anything.
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Same old story.
That can't be.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
We've got powder but no ball!
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
Yes, I believe so.
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
Lafayette is a child!
Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
What's the difference?
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
They help me understand why we fight.
But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Some things must never change.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
But not more than your comfort.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Africa, of course.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
Well, we must be who we must be...
That's good... who?
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
Juba was a Numidian.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
I guess still in the locker.
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
Not too bad.
Yayo. Where is he?
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Tell you what...
She can't talk right now.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
Where you been, Harry?
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
Ever shot anybody.
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
With what? Wiseguy money?
Wait. How about this?
That's not bad.
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
They report it to the IRS.
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
Sit down, Leo.
How much is the wife offered?
...That's what we finally decided.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
There a part in it for you?
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
Really.
Oh.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
He already knew it.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
I don't have a dog.
That's where you got the idea?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Shylock?
And after all, you have such morals.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Maureen?
Yeah.
Or uninvited guests.
A what?
If you get it back in one piece.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
Like I always say --
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
She take a radio?
I don't know what you're talking about?
Don't lie to me!
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
What?
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
What guy?
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
The what?
What?
I think I see it pretty well.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
You're up late.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
Drink up then.
Lost my sea legs.
You don't remember?
Say what?
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
The mooring hasn't come taught.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
No, no. You got leak.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
But I can't --
JUST DO IT!
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Huh?
I didn't check my messages...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Hi.
What do you mean "why"?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Okay... I promise.
What? Why?
He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
Good.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
That lets us off the hook.
Or maybe not.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
Oh, we totally have to.
I've been looking all over for this.
What a little hosebag.
I remember every minute of that party.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
Come on, it's too late now...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
Somewhere downtown.
What are you talking about?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
No way... when?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Go ahead...
God, you're really obsessed...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
So where's all your stuff?
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
You're late, asshole.
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Wow!
Hey, I was only kidding!
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
I - I'd really rather not...
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Are you okay?
What, like a girdle?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Why?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
So, what happened?
YAAA!
Really?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
What's up?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
So where would we go?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Call me sometime.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Right, exactly!
She's not at home?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
That slut!
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
You've never built in Africa.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
We have hunted since childhood.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Have you got that in writing? 
Does he speak English?
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
So that's what a lion looks like. 
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
What did I do?
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
Have you ever failed?
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
Was that supposed to make me feel better? 
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
I don't know what to do anymore.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Hello, Venkman.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Good idea.
What's the reading?
Nine feet -- ten --
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
Then let's do it.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
And decent.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Are you sick, Louis?
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
I know.  It happened by itself.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Great!  How's it going?
The magic word is "please."
Two wavy lines?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Wow!
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Why not?
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Gozer.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
LATER, MAN!!
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Not yet, dear brother...
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
Caesar?
We have to stop the Germans now!
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
God of passages and changes?
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Why you?
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
Well, we can try...
My troops don't make policy.
I was summoned.
Of course...
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
I'd love some.
I just want to tell you something.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
All right.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Of course not.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
That woman --
Don't cry. 
Come in.
Did you say rape her?
Well -- where are you going?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Oh no. He said that.
Shhhh.
No.
Thank you.
One of those outside agitators.
What for?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Benjamin?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Give me an hour.
What?
A single room or a double room?
Of course.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Please.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
What do you think?
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
It's all right.
Come on.
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Of course.
Waiter!
Now?
Why don't you get it.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Benjamin.
Okay.
That you're afraid --
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
I don't.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
There!
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Don't tell Elaine.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Was he a law student at the time?
Yes.
I don't think we were the first.
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Let's drop it.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Well, I'm not.
Of course I wouldn't.
If that's how you feel --
Where is Elaine?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
No, I do. I want to tell you.
I do.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
What about it?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
Swell. I appreciate it.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Thank you.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Mr. Robinson?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Yes, I can.
I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
No.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
I have an idea working in my head... 
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Dictation.  You know...
Money.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Yes --
You live here?
For tonight. 
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
I want to be alone.
You are beautiful!
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Really?
And?
Oh -- 
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Shall I see you again?
Very early in the morning.
Till then.
Not at all, sir. 
Oh, a Baron! 
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- but the audience.
Yes, I was in the war.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Later?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Oh yes, of course.
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
Then you will please wait outside.
Moreover --
Perhaps. 
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
No -- now.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
I had to arrange about the trip.
Here, hold up!
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Then, it's all over?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Preysing, you're joking with us.
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
What a session this has been.
You see -- what we are interested in --
You haven't time.
Such nonsense.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
I will. So long, Bobo.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Fine.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
But what's wrong?
It's not your fault.
Roy Dillon.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
They twisted my arm.
Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
Bluebell came in?
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
You, too, Roy.
No.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
You must have some money.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Not very good!
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
We'll work something out, Joe.
In your other hand.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
Every day in every way.
You ain't seen nothin.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
I saw her.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
That's natural.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
I like a woman who takes control.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Nothing's missing?
Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
My life is a living hell.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Will, sit down...
Please, get on the bus...
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then I'll get caught.
Still wants to move out?
This kid just wants his freedom.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Yeah.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Thanks!
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Okay ... But just for tonight.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
It's a rune ... Thorn.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
This is madness, Wynn.
It was you.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Samhain.
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
Tell them yourself!
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
I'm liable to find anything!
Let's talk about it some other time.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
How are you, honeybunch?
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
As a matter of fact--
Do you know who Wanda June is?
He worships Father.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
"The sting."
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
Mhravitch.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Can't it keep till morning?
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Scat!
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
Eighteen--  and a half.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Situation.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
We thought a doctor might help.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
Please--
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
People don't use that word any more.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Such as?...
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
Yes.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
Did you like it, dear?
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Ooops.
It's always locked.
He's dead, you know.
Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
You've been bitten by bats?
I was going to ask.
I've never heard of it.
We have, have we?
I'm high as a kite.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
I'm going to shoot you now.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
If you want to be found that way.
No.
What are you going to do?
Who's dead?
I dunno.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
No.
Thank you, kind sir.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
That's an interesting piece of news.
A lot of people don't.
I don't really know.
What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
No.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
My father!
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
That's something I suppose.
I know.
Far as I know.
The park!
How long has this been going on?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Take plenty of cigars.
Tonight's the night.
It is?
Meaning?
Is that a fact?
Phooey.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
It's good.  Let him go.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
What are you doing?
I just want to ask some questions.
No, I don't.
What?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Overpowering?
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Where's he?
I am.
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
Jesus.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Say what?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
You don't understand shit.
Neither am I.
How important do you think sex is?
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
They were here?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
I can stop if you want.
No, please go on.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
On your own land?
Andy.
What are you paying me for?
That's like a stag film.
Where did you get that film?
Who made it?
What's it called?
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
What?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
Yeah.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Ratan!
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
What exactly do you have in mind?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Huh?
To anybody.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Yes.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Sort of.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
My door is always open.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
Well...
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
I don't know.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Well, I really don't smoke.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
With Life.
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Well, don't go.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
"And this too shall pass away."
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
Just give me a rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
Why?
Your studies?
Thank you, Uncle.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
That's right.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Harold!
She took my head.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Frank.
She certainly has.
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Kyle, you don't have...
I've got to finish it.
And what about you?
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Who?
The Cenobites.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
I'm lucky that way.
See? I don't like that --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
No. It's not.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
I thought you liked being on TV.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Is it bad?
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Anung-un-Rama...
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
My arm is fine. Where are you??
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
Yes?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
You're going alone?
Strong.
Just take it slowly.
My fucking hand!
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
You remember.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Oh my God.
Tell me who you are.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
So you were cheated.
And the blood let you out?
I said no.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe.
There's very little I can do about it.
Hi. I got soaked.
Just to your left.
I have to see my father.
The best part of ten years.
So what's the argument?
Oh Christ. Julia...
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
No you won't.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
There's a first time for everything.
No.
I won't be a moment.
Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
Steve.
No Dad.
You like?
Kirsty.
Really?
Gone?
I don't believe it.
What's the problem?
So lie down.
Not that late.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
What did I say?
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
How do you know about that?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Laura.  Her dad died.
Haven't seen it.
Yes way.  It's really...
NO--!
Oh well.  Nevermind.
On Clark Street!
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Is there a difference?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Yeah.
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City."
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Okay.
Can I help you?
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Think about it, Rob.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
Are you coming home?
-- Alright, alright but --
I don't know.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
It sounds stupid.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Never?
Will you please just go?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Pigsty.
Do you want me to be there?
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I don't want to go back.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
I'm alright.
How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
Where?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Just local, of course.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Would you marry me if I was?
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Everything all right?
How's the store?
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Thirteen hundred.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
No, we...
Fuck off.
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
Fine.
You're very macabre.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
The boy _died_?
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Grave robbers?
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
You make it all sound so simple.
Follow me.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
He is older than I.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Of bodies.
There are differences.
Damn you.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
No!
Not power.  Not control.
Yes.
I'm just curious.
We've got nothing to say.
All fashionably without heads.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
What were you doing in Felton?
Aye.
You know me home.  Me name.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
It is less.
I don't understand.
It is the truth.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
Do what you must.
Like you.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Your father must be smart.
Yes, he was.
I don't know.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Sit.
It's good to see you, Kahn.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
This isn't done.  Get up.
American.
That's none of your business.
He's mistaken.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
What doing?
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
The check, Bruce!
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Oh, yes. Here it is.
I'm Bruce Baldwin!
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
So long.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
No, you don't!
Hello, Hildy!
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Listen, Walter --
No!
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
The insurance business?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
We're not interested.
What tricks would I pull?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
What did you do with her?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Sure, boss.
It's a deal. Let me up.
Yes, sir.
Point the gun at me!
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
That's all right.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
What do you mean -- through?
If there was any way out...
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Now what do you say?
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
Very simple, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
What do you mean?
Get the Governor on the phone!
How much do you make a week?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
The City Sealer's office!
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
A very fine-looking women.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Hello, Mollie.
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
What's he want?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I know.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Apparently so.
Looking for shrapnel.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
I only know one.
Sod.
Won't they have maps?
You couldn't.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
Who with?
They've got the real thing outside.
I'm starting my own collection.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
You need trees for an avenue.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
What's that?
You joined up.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Fair enough.  The river.
There, there, my baby.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
I wish it could all have been different.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
No, I told you...
Couple more miles up this road.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
What?
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
You mean John Wayne?
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Yeah.
How awesome?
Really fucking awesome.
Hell yeah.
Cat fight, cat fight.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
No problem.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
There's not enough room.
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
I gotta open the gate.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
What!
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
What! God damn, how many?
What should I do?
George Willis...  ...any leads?
I ain't got a warrant.
Right.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
I always favored the Hulk.
Aw, fuck.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
French?
Oui.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Oui. Perfect!
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
We still have you and I.
Shan't happen again.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Loves animals. Loves you.
What do you mean?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Yeah?
You've got to respect that.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
My God! The fork! The fork!
I'm sorry?
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
That's a great idea.
Terrific. Can't wait!
Fifteen.
Absolutely.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
All right.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Good. Making progress.
Do you like my new look?
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Such as what womanly things?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila...
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Ugnh.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
No.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
That's right, Miss Packard.
Thank you.
How much do I owe you?
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Sit down.
Thought you only drank milk.
I lost twenty bucks.
Whaddya been so far?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
For who?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Man named Turk Baker?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
How much?
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Want some free advice?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
I feel tight -- but good.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Get with what?
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Yeah. You must come again.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Shoot.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
Do you always ask so many questions?
So why go to college?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I've got something in my bag.
No, why should I? It's yours.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Shut up.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Yes.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Stay alive.
It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
I guess you could say that.
Let's check it out, Dad.
Sure ... fine.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I was so scared.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Can you tell me about that?
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
Where, Jimmy?
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Why, yes.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
It's really nice of you to help us.
Connie, don't hang up.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
He's not going to listen to me.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
That signal. It's a countdown.
So think already.
Dad, don't start.
You still got the Olds?
That's okay. You're driving.
They don't know this.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
But Mr. President...
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
Dick-weed!
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
We're already over Mach 2!
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
Yes.
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
And I am his.
Dad was onto something here!
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
We're through!
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
No. You like the way I do things.
Thank God!
Good point.
They want my diary.
You did!!
Don't worry. He won't.
How did you she was a Nazi?
So did I.
My lucky charm.
Try and burn through the ropes.
Marcus would agree with me.
Good.
I was the next man.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
What does that mean?
I know, Dad!
This could be close.
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
The penitent man. The penitent...
What did you find, Dad?
A long time to wait.
No.
My name is Kazim.
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
You don't like him do you?
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
What?
Two are still missing.
What evil?
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Just one arm!
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
No -- real food.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
You've got to go to sleep now.
Al ???!!!
Me.
Where are we?
No.
Kill myself.
You're not crazy.
Why he's argumentative?
Why don't you?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Then what are you stopping for?
Too late...They want you.
No. Don't tell the guards.
Yeah...Who is?
What do you mean we.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
Just walk down the hall?
Nothing. You just do nothing.
I don't have any.
The beach?
Little late for that.
I don't want to eat it.
Follow it.
What?
To the hotel. To register.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
This...is not going to work out.
Not blue enough.
What glasses.
What is it?
Oh come on.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
Too late.
I can't see a thing.
Not sure at all.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
What exactly?
Keep thinking.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
The best part. She'll love it.
Let us get to the border!
In him?
Who's our little man?
Surveilliance on them all.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
And how do you service foreigners.
Oh....Sure.
You'll feel better
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
A little voice in my head.
...right here too.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
You're doing...Okay.
Is that Ryuji?
What do you mean?
There's not much to tell.
You work for Ryuji?
You did.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
I'm leaving too.
This business is over.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Who was?
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
I know the territory.
Now what?
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
I know a nice island.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Thanks.
The experiment. The danger...
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Whoever took it does.
Hi, Daddy.
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Push it.
Good.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
I'm afraid you are.
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Catch ya' later.
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Call me back in ten.
Why?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Area code 212-555-0199.
That's right...
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
I disappeared on you?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Oh, please, Mike...
Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
It's obvious, isn't it?
Tempura...
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
You charge by the hour?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
No.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
You greased the rails!
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Right.
Poor communication skills.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
Howard!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
What part?
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
Set one side for Bel Air.
We did not.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Gotcha.
Well, don't look at mine!
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Have you tried the duck?
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
No.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
I have a watch.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
I have a surprise for you.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Those are gifts.
That's marriage.
You do? You do love me?
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
He was right, wasn't he?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Heh heh.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
She brought my digestive enzymes.
And she has...?
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
Is she going through with it?
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Do you have it?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Who's Rex's guy?
How is she?
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Yeah.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
I'll get it annulled.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
On the road.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Oh, no—no.
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
What would you like to have me do?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Are you talking to me?
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
My ticket?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
I never thought of that.
That's none of your business.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Nope. No complaints.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Yeah?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Next week "East Lynne."
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I don't trust that chatterbox.
What do you mean—starvation?
Yeah.
Okay. Hang on to these.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
Of course it is.
What?
What's got into you?
Here. Eat your head off.
But what!
What?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Amazing.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
You bet I did.
Won't I ever see you again?
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Huh?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Don't accept any more.
That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
I dunno.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Mebbe.
Wife?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
No.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Not one word.  That's an order.
Did he pay?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
There were no phone records.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Yeah.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
Calm down, Dave, what?
How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
I see.  And where did you drive?
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Take a look across the street.
...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
Germany.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
That sounds fun.
And how tall are you?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
But then you told her you were home.
I'll call her.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Uh-huh.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
Thanks.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Can you do it or not?
Fine.
I'd love one, but not there.
Is it dark?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Sure.
The Delfonics.
What?... What'd you do?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
"American President"
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
They seem to like the idea.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
You know some interesting people.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
Why?
I hesitated taking that much.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
If I don't cooperate?
Yeah?
Can I smoke?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
He sells guns.
You two meet?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
I never have. It's not my money.
There was a guy with Melanie?
If it'll make you happy.
I thought you were watching him.
What about you?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
And what was your answer?
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
I don't know. One of your friends.
So we need two people, two women.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
Managers get ten percent.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
What does she think she's gettin?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
Susanville.
Two months shy of four years.
Four years?
It's a diet thing?
So where did you go?
Where were you?
I don't like dancing.
Must of made quite an impression.
That sounds like a problem.
Yeah.
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
Okay, Lou-is.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
What do I do?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
Where did you shoot her?
Where's the rest of it?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Max Cherry.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Yeah.
Ten thousand sounds high.
You think you could do that?
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Is that what I think it is?
Winston found you.
My office.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Yes.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Give me his home number.
What are you then?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Just to see you. That's all.
I'm okay.
That's right. We did.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
I'm hanging up.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Now what?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
I am.
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
She talk about the boys?
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
I know.
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
New? He's been here for years.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
No. Don't move me.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Where to?
Don't ask.
Did you look around the headboard?
No. The little one.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
What's in here?
They're like demons, Jez.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Here. I'll do it.
What?
While you were in the shower.
Jezzie?
Who else were you expecting?
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I'm not upset.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
You got a nice tan, though.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Total delirium.
For what? For seeking the truth?
We're not going to hurt you.
He'll never make it.
Where am I?
Paul Gruneger!
Nothin' much.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know what to do.
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
What do you mean, not enough time?
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Rizzo did.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
But I didn't see...
Fuckin A...
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
Negative.
I hope so.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Were you close to your father?
Okay, good tip.
Old woman?
No shit. I got no problem with that.
I'm on my way.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Well, do something!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Barbie from hell...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Are there any other shuttles?
I gotta go back.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
More soldiers?
Exactly.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Just a favor for your old man.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Do I need any more authority?
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
Why?
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
And nobody else saw her in the water?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Do I set the goddam hook?
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
What do you see?
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
I don't think so.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
I'll try to drop by later.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Yup.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
I know enough.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
You're something else.
Why? What the big deal?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What are you?
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Vanessa, right?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Juno MacGuff.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
You're pregnant?
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Thundercats are go!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Share the love, Tits!
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Right, seriously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
I suppose anything's possible.
Not really.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Best kind.
Brian.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
Yeah.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
What happened to Adele?
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
...just like that?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
Fuck!
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
Nervous?
She wasn't feeling so good.
Siesta.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
His Parole Officer.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Umm. Altogether?
You fucked it?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Did what take?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Yeah.
Who?
Yeah.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Yeah probably.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
You sure?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
What?
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
You have?
Yeah.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Why?
Because, you know why. You know.
Do you care about me?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Boom!!! Boom!!!
I gotta find him.
Do you know where he went?
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Shh.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
You are!  I don't like you.
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
I'm positive.
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
Get off me!
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
But a hundred men could move him.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
You're not going to tell me that.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Just like who?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
You like to brag, don't you?
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
What word did you leave last night?
By that time the game will be over.
Please... wait.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
No!  Wait!!
Very good.  How did you know?
The pipes.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
No problem.  We're in.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Six, eight hours tops.
Bingo.
No prints.
Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
Yeah.
How long she been dead?
We're not sure.
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
Meaning?
We're going to work on the message.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
I went out.
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Yes.
Are you one of the players?
It seems like such a complicated game.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
You sound like my mother.
It wasn't intentional.
In a way.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Let's change the subject.
Of course.
Why?
I tried again and got through.
Where's the note?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I got lucky.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
We're almost married.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
All directions are the same here.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
You have rope?
Yes.
The Beast will kill her.
I chose the wrong passage.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
I cannot.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
I have need of friends.
Fame.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
I am Quell.
I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
I only want one.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
I knew.
The new King.
You know the voice.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
It is too late. He has drunk.
That is true.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
Knowledge.
Of what?
...Office 2702.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
What, for example?
Perfect.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
No.
No, you can't go out.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...I got lost, Mister.
I have no fear.
Huh? Why?
...And how much is it?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
It's impossible.
I'll make it.
Maybe later.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Yes -- you are.
Okay.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
You're talking to me?
I will -- I promise.
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
Yes.
It'll make it.
He's plastered.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
By car right?
The Gazette's small huh?
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Tomorrow.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
Steph.
Someone should be with you.
Forty-seven years.
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Oh, and what did you do?
Can we just ignore it?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
OK.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
What did they look like?
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
Yuri... are you...
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
How?
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
Yes, I am.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
I think so...
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
What?
Yes, you are.
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Margot!
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
You're serious?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Projecting joy is not my job.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
Really --
Why not?
Of course, I do!
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
That's why I think it's time for us to --
That's not entirely --
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
Thank you. Having fun?
See?
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Faith.
What do you want with me?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
Grotesque... monstrous...
You... you're a beast!
Oh, yes...
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
And, now?
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Who might these friends be?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
What!
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
What does she want from me?
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Don't you know?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
And who might that be?
Knaves and robbers...
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Blackheart?
What know you of fields of war?
Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
The chill is worse this night.
Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
I'll try.
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Sorry.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Be patient.
What's the matter?
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
No fear of that now.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
We wait.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
We did a lot of the wiring too.
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Red.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
What are you doing here?
We're not gonna do anything.
It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
Josh said...
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Will he talk to me?
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Oh, yes.
A sink?
Pardon me?
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
Thank you.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I'll get your bag.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
No you don't.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
You're so predictable.
When are you going to be back?
Well, until you know, you can't go.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
I'm not even listening.
What are you now?
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
I still don't know what that means.
You lied to me!
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Left you this place.
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
What did you do with your dog?
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
One of you would end up dead.
I can't leave the house?
Well, for later then.
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
My stupid back.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
You're a good mother.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
It would worry me.
Sooner than the Fall.
Either do you.
I didn't go in your room.
Can you stay for dinner?
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
You could keep it and rent it out?
This is what he wants.
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Yeah...
Why not?
Sure, boss.
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
I know it begins with a "C"...
You went to Monroe?
I don't see where that's any of your business.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Uh-huh.
You need collateral.
Yeah, I want some pie.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
I don't know. Who do you want?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Let me see that.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
'Preciate it. Claude.
No problem. Oh, boy!
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
1932? That's like, that's like...
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
Let her go.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
You're already there...
It's not me, moron.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Well, let's rock and roll.
He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
Beast.
It's Stanley, sir.
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
By she, do you mean he?
So I followed him...
You smell like coconuts.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
A black guy?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
What other food?
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
At Carousel tonight?
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
He was killed.
Curious.
K.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
I have.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
For us.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
You know, Jessica.
Of course.
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
And Sanctuary?
Beloved wife...
Hello.
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
More... many more.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
Pile in.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
Yeah, I remember.
I don't know.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Okay, baby.
Sure.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
How'd it happen, Alice?
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Sure.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Sit down a minute.
Sit down.
Yeah? what did they want?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
No.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
No... Here he comes.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
He didn't come home.
Not even close.
The first night... Not the last two.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
What are you going to do?
Wake me up when you get home.
A videotape.
Does it say anything on the tape?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
I called, you know.
Who the hell owns that dog?
All right.
Why would anyone do something like this?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
You really don't remember?
It was weird...
Come on... get in.
I was?
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Yes, sir.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Yes!
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
I'm thinking.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
No.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
So there are others?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
They were.
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Yes.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
Mine?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants—  —and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
I don't know.
That's what you said.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
I don't see that there's anything to say.
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
What about the others?
What was that?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
Go? Where?
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
Cowan--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Yes, sir.
Actually, sir--
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Why?  What are you gonna do?
Ha ha.  No, really.
Why?
You don't know me at all.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Hold it.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
For how long?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Actually, you may have.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
It's... coming.
Yeah, I'll talk to you.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Cause I think we're looking at it.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
May I have a look?
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
Who wanted her little girl back?
What --
I know... I do, too...
Right.  I know --
We know each other?
You set your patients on fire!
-- go blind.  I know.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Kill type?
The nation votes this week...
Tuck in your shirt.
I go running down there.
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Uh, sir...
Now look at him...
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
You mind if I tag along?
Because it was going to fall.
Just a nickname.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
She said...
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
I guess that's all of it.
That's great.
Heal who?
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
You said they're destroyed.
-- and then walk out.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
You're insane or you think I am.
The female.
I don't know who that is.
We know why John was tagged.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I wanna kill my boss.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
You mean after he lost your son.
What does he want with a precog?
Good luck.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Are you sure?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Bullshit.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Draw.
5-5-1.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Ricky's taken care of.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Why?
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I know.
Yeah.
You told him you liked him.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Take a few days --
Nah, man...
Bobby.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Can you check?
Any time, bro.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So, it's not a winning record.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I'll page you.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Bullshit...
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
What's the movie?
Nah, don't bother --
Oh, I'll represent alright.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Yeah, I guess.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Well, I don't want to walk.
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. 
She was jonesing for me.
We're not getting whacked.
I'm your soldier.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Float me a hundred bucks.
It's gonna be fine.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Where do you get this shit?
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I'll be a minute.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
No, really, mate?
Come, now. You just got here.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
Yeah.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
What?
Tell me.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
What?
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
He had it coming.
Keeps me out of the army.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
What you talking?
There's two guns on you.
Now.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
What did you give it to me for then?
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Who are you?
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Just an idle question.
The talk is everywhere!
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Allah Akbar.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
And like a fool I believe it.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Did you hear me?!
And don't come back.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Shorty, this is Laura.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
Watch your tongue, boy.
[I have a friend there.]
I have connections.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
[Daniel what?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Who's he?]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
It's loaded.
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
No.
No.
Not at all?
I go to school, don't I?
It's better to be free, right?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
You feel sorry for the husband?
Yes.
I know you're not.
Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
Could I stop you?
I'm fine.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
When?
What? Who?
That's ridiculous.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
It pains that they should do this.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Yes, I know.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Sure.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I never thoughta that.
Sure, what?
Don't worry about it.
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Marty...
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Sure.
What, Ma?
...and they sit down right next to me...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hiya.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Okay.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
Tommy...
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
We think the same way.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
I think I heard about that.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Radar!
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
Not necessarily.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
It's possible
How did you get called that?
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Glad to help.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Yes, dammit, and...
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Splendid, sir. No problems.
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
Boys, we're home free.
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Yeah, I'm all right.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Uh-huh.
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Yes, sir.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
Mr. D. B. Norton!
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
The Websters.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
There is no letter.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Well, maybe you're right.
I got it all ready. Here.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Yeah, a little.
Where'd you play?
I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
A what?
The elevators are still runnin'.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
No.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
She isn't?
What do you mean, too bad?
Okay.
What?
I didn't see anything.
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
Yeah, okay.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
You got it.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Being faxed over now.
Roper, we're into it...
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Yeah.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
National Marksman Competition.
Is there something wrong with that?
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Still needs work.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
So what do you want to do?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
I worship you.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Can I come in?
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
As a matter of fact, I do.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
And it's hard to get.
Yeah that's it.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
Any verification on numbers.
Why --
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
This is how you pick up women --
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Then what?
Not real?
Dream?!
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
And what about the reconfiguration?
The woman you're stuck on.
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
-- Who did he digitize?!
The truth.
Why would I do that?
To hide the evidence.
Then where is she?
Cleaning up a mess.
What are you talking about?
Who are you?!
Realize?
-- Transmit now!
-- Waiter.
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
What does that mean?!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Why should I be?
No. Not everything.
Scared.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
Long as Charlie says.
Who'll make the rules?
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Who?
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
You get fifteen percent.
And the Jews?
They do what I tell 'em.
The terms will be mine.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
I turned him down flat.
Wanna know what I think?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Fuck 'em.
You wouldn't live out the week.
Best we got.
Yeah...before your time.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
Uhh - martini?
<u>Why</u>??
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
YOU SET ME UP!!
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I need a new PR guy.
Who?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
I just need to use the phone, lady.
We like to think so, yeah.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
He seemed quite taken with you.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Mm hmm.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Oh--yeah--
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Drunks are funny--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
How about getting married?
Have *you*?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Susan? Nah!
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Y-yes, Jim.
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
The--head?
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Himself!
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Ah, now, that's better.
For a *question*.
Mr. President--
Certainly would, Joseph.
We'd better see.
*No*!
The man downstairs said number--
There *what* was?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Thanks very much.
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Yes, yes--
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Abigail.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Do you want to dictate them?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Wonderful!
Well! You don't say!
Well--I--
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
Yes, sir--
How's that, buddy?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Well--I have got *one* idea--
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
What do you mean? What's going on?
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Susan!
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Deeds?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Yes, sir.
Next, please.
I haven't.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Are these the articles?
But they did take place?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
What?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
What did you mean by that?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
You have?
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
In a day or so, I think.
I don't blame you.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Yes, of course.
Oh, hello darling.
No. It's nothing.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
With pay!
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Did it?
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Gold, eh?
Oh, yes sir.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
We'll send for the police!
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Mr. Cedar!
Where?
How do you do.
When?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
No, thanks.
That's funny. Why is that?
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing—
We own an opera house, don't we?
Why not?
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
No, I mean - about my client.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
Yes, ma'am.
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
Yes, sir.
Oh, I do too, sir.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
Could you come with me please?
Are we?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
What's that?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Do you want to come in?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Oh?
What?
Doc.  Ainge...
It's a pretty piece of land.
...so accomplished.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
No, I really don't.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Life.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
I don't know if --
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I think so.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Will you be here?
In maybe three or four issues.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
It's my bit for the community.
Where was this?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Was it something that happened at school?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
It matters to me.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
I'm honored.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
I guess that makes sense.
What?
You're not going to kill us?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
None of the above, thank you.
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
What does he want the book for?
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
Oh yes, always.
What is he doing here?
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
To be hanged.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Two hundred pounds.
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
No.
No, I mean --
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
What are those mirrors for?
For entering the afterlife.
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
Something like that.
And what is that?
Not unless you call me Rick.
Very slowly.
I'm staying.
FINE.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Awfully.
I know you knew I'd know.
What --?
Your mind is so slippery.
Do I?
I'm his daughter.
When was that?
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
I can't.
Let's do it.
What did he mean?
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Captain who?
So are you!
Frankenstein!
Then why are you here?
What's your real name?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Yes.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
Not a chance!
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
So why don't you just tell her!
Who's chicken? 
Well they've crawled back out.
Yes.
Not yet.
Or Batman --
Be a Mohican. 
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
Proceed.
And, what a delightful idea!
What do you mean?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I'm not insulted.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Yes, sir.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
I'll have the fire built up.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Are you trying to insult me?
Well, you shall see.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Five minutes.
Yes.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
That's all I can say.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
You couldn't face telling me what?
Do you know what you're saying?
Yes, I do -- very much.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
That is a matter of opinion.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
You paid cash?
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
What happen?
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
I didn't see nothing.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Why didn't she put'em out?
It's locked.
Hold on.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Just hold your breath.
Have you seen Day-Day?
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
You don't wanna know.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
And some rolling papers.
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
I don't know, Debo.
I'll take you later.
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
What's he doing here?
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
What?
Huh?
I appreciate that.
That's...a comfort to hear.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
Who did?
What?
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
What about the gun?
You know what I'm gonna do.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I think you're right.
We made it.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
Fuck you!
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
You're a big girl, huh?
A surprise?
It better be.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
Young love.
What gives?
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Listen to me John.
When'll the skiff be ready?
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
So you ain't with the State no more?
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Sshhh! He's in there.
I'll be switched!...
Bluebeard!
Fiddlesticks!
Pearl dotes on him.
It's a shame!
There! What's so hard about that!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
Hush.
That's Daddy!
Dead. 
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
Yes?
What's your name?
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Why, pray tell?
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
When did I ever?
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Used to. Not anymore.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Well what you reading it for?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
You don't know he did it.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
She lived there.
I don't mean her --
'Anything funny' like what?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Right.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
Just sleep now, Mom.
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Bring me forty-five back.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
You should be more careful, Anna.
About what?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
And there?
Just for the honeymoon.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
That's right.
That's another thing... it's spring.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
We have opened a restaurant...
The former Duchess!
Go to bed.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
What is it, my boy?
While you eat, you look at the view.
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
I'll send you a muff.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Well, we're back home.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Private.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Yes!
No visa.
I must get into that country of yours!
Me?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I'll try.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
I will do my best.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
I didn't follow you.
What are you after?
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
What?
At what?
Because we are an odd couple.
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Darling, darling... please!
Shhh! Shhh!
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Radio! What is radio?
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
No.
You haven't seen her yet?
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Has done what?
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Yes, it does.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Please... sit down.
Thank you.
May I ask what has happened?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
So ... let's go ...
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
I figured that out.
Yeah?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
For what?!
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Sir?
Silence!
All right.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
You never told him?
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Sir?
We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Why me?
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
What'd you say?
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Mr. Castro.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
You should ask Bobby.
I always get my man.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Jesus Christ!
... but it was all we had.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yes, I understand that.
POWs.  And their families.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
Not that.  Us.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Tomorrow.
You.  What' you're doing --
You're drunk!
Lost.
What?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
How you been, Ellis?
How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
Try "old" on for size.
Uh-huh.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
The old boy shot by the highway?
That's very linear Sheriff.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
That's possible.
I'm ahead of you there.
Wasn't no bullet.
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
Yessir.
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
I always am.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
Well I didn't see it.
To your husband.
At the gettin' place.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
What're you doin', baby?
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Screwgie.
Not a bleep.
Airport.
I don't know.
Yeah? Where am I?
All right.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
For what?
Everything.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Yessir. I understand that.
Well enough.
I'm sorry.
You want to change rooms?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
Nam?
Could I have that in American?
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Did you send anyone out there?
I know that...
What about it?
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
I better go check on them.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
The LeSabre!
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Of course.
Didn't I?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
...well, then you ain't got much.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Yes.
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I'd slap his face.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
You made out alright.
...did I win some contest?
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
I was talking about what you could wear!
Doctor David Ravell.
HE IS REAL!!
You never know who you'll see.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Your husband?!
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Beer, please.
That is so right.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
What's wrong with you?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
You better believe it.
He's waiting...
No! Let me try this!
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
No... before that.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Did Chloe crack?
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
- but now it deposits you here.
You can't do this -
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Huh?!
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Not that I'm aware.
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Oh my God!
Everett, my beard itches.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Now Penny, stop that!
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Not your...
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
You -
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
Great.
What for?
Thank you, sir!
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Not exactly, sir.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Then, I'll see you around.
I'm a little late, that's all.
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
I got my foot on the floor.
I do.
No! That's not true!
Really?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Be a friend. Leave.
Any time, sailor.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I bet you do!
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
But it can't wait.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
Remember that.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
You finish.  Then we finish.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
This was your department, Junior.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Different tables.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
I did.
Hey.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Huh?
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
It's okay, Raoul.
Why?
That room!
PANIC ROOM!
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
I heard you.
Huh uh.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
I am.  I'm here.
Shhh...
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
What's up?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Who's they?
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
No Fuck you!!!
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Can you make a deal with them?
Are you finished?
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
You mean...
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
With a lace table cloth?
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
Not yet.  What happened?
I have no choice, I...
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
What?
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
Go on.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
And your principles?
We saw.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Goodbye, Harry.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
God willing.
Ayuh.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
I'm sure you're not.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Whose burying ground?
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
I'm thinking about going to bed.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Yes, I guess I do.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Louis, are you sure?
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
All right then.
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
What?
I know the code.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
The trees are taller.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
First -- have you found me a crew?
And you've got that, have you?
That he is.
She can hold a bit longer.
We're catching up!
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Where does it make berth?
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Aye!  Avast!
Is that so?
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
It's the right way.
No, it's not.
No.
... no.
No.  She hasn't.
Speak.
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
A man?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
The replicators?
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
What are you going to do?
Like Crazy Glue?
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
I guess I should be flattered.
It already is.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
Susan, this is the future of America here.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
No, no, I just feel wired!
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Yeah.  Old times.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
Something else I want to try.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Let's go.
The same thing I suppose.
God, what a fight that was.
Don't worry, four eyes.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Yes - isn't it.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
You're all right.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
Now let's get this settled—
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Oh, hello Mother!
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.
Right - for the first time this year.
Come on, get going, get going!
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
A what?
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see—'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha—
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Yes sir!
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you—
Yes.
It's the smoke.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Nothing.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Hello, Hank. How are you?
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Okay.
Conrad.
What could I be?
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Well, at best you might deny it.
I suppose you know why I came—?
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
I have. Double-strength!
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Yes.
What do you mean?
Yeah ...  That--and ...
It doesn't matter.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Sure you are.
I don't want it to go away.
Really Biff? The keenest?
I think ... I might be ill ...
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
Very well ...
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
YOU get lost!
You--you gotta get us out of here.
Neither do I.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
As a matter of fact he does.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
Really? It seems so fattening.
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
Wow.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
You don't know?
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
Yeah.
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
Real rain?
Scout?
Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
COME BACK!!!
... Hi.
What?
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
I had nothing to do with that.
Why?
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Yes.
Yeah ...
I'll never be able to do that.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah. 
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
So you're coming tonight, right?
Are you gonna do it?
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Sure.
...just talking to you....
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Georgia.
Hi....what....what's up....?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
I don't know.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Yeah.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Yeah.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Oh that's great.
If you come to Hawaii --
Really?
Lena?
I just wanted to make sure.
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
Yeah.
You left me at the hospital.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Bye.
The police are on their way.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your name?
Barry Egan.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
That's that.
I think you have a call?
And I'm sorry that I did that.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I need to talk to you for a second.
Wait a minute --
Alright, alright.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
Seven o'clock.
I won't.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Yeah.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
He did seem a little strange.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
Then what's he doing here?
Now give the signal.
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
"Turn you out?"
Why not?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Mustn't do that, sir.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
That's enough.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
I know, because I felt it myself --
Go to hell!
Why was it you never took her by force?
It's a formality; truly.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
His wife's?
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
Shut down?
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
You find this amusing, do you?
And --?
That's not our intent --
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
You'd suffer in her stead?
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Enough!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
I don't believe it!
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
Not you too
Mm.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
To make pictures.
So I've been told.
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
Uh-hub.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Not for me.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
We're doing Hearst.
I expected more from you.
Sorry to disappoint.
I don't have it anymore?!
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
Why her?
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
The title?
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Herman.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
You want to do the life of Jesus?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
I'm Ok.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
Believe what you want.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
Nothing...
Sure. What is it?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Yeah --
You know, like bang her or anything?
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
But you said "you."
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
No.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Come here.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Positive.
All I did...
Jake...
What'd you see?
I am answering...
Jake --
Why don't you just call him up?
Sure, what else is new?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Never felt better.
And you're drinking with them right now.
But his leg!
You think I made all this up?
I was jaywalking.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Give him evidence.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Oh -- I almost forgot!
You sure it belongs to his wife?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
That depends on who "they" were.
Your Lisa?
A possibility.
Where'd they take Lisa?
You did.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Lisa Fremont.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
I'm not ready for marriage.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
People have different emotional levels that --
How did you know!
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Now wait a minute --
Smart? She'll be arrested!
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
Tired?
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
I mean what I said.
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
What is it you're looking for?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
What's the apartment house number?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
What doesn't?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
But you're not?
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
What?
Smashed the front door.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You still want to go home, Moose?
And you dropped it?
Yeah!  Shh!
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
I was in it.
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
I still think you should go down.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Well maybe she better start.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Come back tomorrow.
Jim.  What's yours?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
I just don't want trouble.
No.  It's okay.
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Yeah?
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
Why?
I need it.
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
Try the desk.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
Mess that kid up?
And your folks didn't understand?
You serious?
See, I'm new.
A what?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
What?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
I didn't want to stop.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Must have a way with stationery.
A man of some travels.
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Toys for... adults?
We sell children's toys --
Thank you.
No, hey, I like your coat --
Smile.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Tell me again.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
I'll see what I can do.
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
You're in on this.
Nick died for me....
Canada.
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Get your own room.
I love you, Nick...
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
I don't know...
Part of... with them?
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Merry Christmas.
What are you talking about?
What?
Bam Bam.
A station wagon in Canada.
I said, who the hell made the map?
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
Nnn... nothing...
NO!
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
He's not Nick Mason...
OPEN IT!!!
What?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
I'm just saying.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
YOU TELL HER!
You gave them me.
What? No...
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Fine, now.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Bullshit.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
How can you tell?
The Brewers.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
Mr. Brown?
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Dead as Dillinger.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
He don't believe in it.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Fuck all that.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
What do you think?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Of course.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
You can stay here if you like.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
Where do you keep the can opener?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
You're not going out to look for them?
Maybe it's better that way.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Finished, son?
There's only two of them now.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
I don't care what she asked you.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
I don't care.
I said I didn't care.
That's a good girl.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
Even women?
They went on like I told you.
They shouldn't have done that.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
How many ways can a man say no.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Yeah, we sure have.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Maybe I could start you out.
That's the end of the line.
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
I feel good anyways.
Steve --
I found a picture of his wife.
Wife?!
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Open chest!!!
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Alright!
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
I was thinking the same thing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
It's okay.
Oh, right.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Made you say it!
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
I don't need your help.
Hey, I got an idea.
Who?
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
The keys. She took the keys.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Just a little Rogaine.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
No, I'm fine.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
"Fucked me."
Don't worry, I got your back.
0h, shit!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Thanks, Mom.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
I'm so happy I could shit.
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Don't wake the kids...
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Are those pussy-willows?
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Right here!
Bon Appetit!
There is one big problem though.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
What's he know?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
You can't tell.
Which room is it?
No.
Yes.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I guess most people are.
I did her hair.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
But you have treated me that way.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
Yes.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I don't know.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
Devil worshippers!
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it —— to know me better.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
They may have been friends of hers.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
It's here, too.
After that wonderful first book —- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
I don't know.
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Please.
What did he say?
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
No. Why?
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Nine years?
Younger.
Who's Elizabeth?
How do you mean?
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Why is that?
You're in therapy?
Of course not.
I can see that. What are they?
Donna?
You went out with her?
Everything about sex.
This is just... so...
Why didn't you tell me?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
Don't you want to make one?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
When we're making love?
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
Do you want me to stop?
About who?
I fantasized about you.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
No.
What was the problem?
So you lied to her?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Like maybe a big part?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
You did that?
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
I ate by myself.
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
What upsets you about that?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
He doesn't have a phone.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Then why'd you call me?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
You are in trouble.
Why?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
Then why do you keep asking about it?
Well. I can't stay.
Bye.
There's a phone here.
It was busy.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
About what?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
Whichever you prefer.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
He said that my hand felt good.
Do you like the way I look?
Okay.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Nothing wrong with trying.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
What do you mean?
John, we have nothing to talk about.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
You were prying before?
She held up very well.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
All right, jesus.
So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
OK. But late.
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
BREAKING OUT
He needs help.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I NEED SOME
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
Flavors!
Foods!
CRIMINAL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
No.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
Good. That's good.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
So I guess that's it.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
Not so bad yourself.
Yeah, Conundrum.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
I'd rather have a knife.
And Lexapro, yes.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Now we're talking.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
She works for tips!
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
She what?  When?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
With Maya?
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
I'm fine!
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Yeah. Okay.
Right now.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Could be anything.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Throw me his ball.
I SAID OKAY?
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Quite a week.
No, I'm okay.
What the fuck!
Why don't you come in?
Yeah.
Maya, how are you?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
See you.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Yeah. Definitely.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
I guess.
About a year.
I told you I need a drink.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Oops. Sorry.
Where?
Does she ever answer back?
This one?
My ballet recital.
Hi baby.
I don't feel much.
...Tell Graham --
That's right.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
From what?
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
I just asked his name.
You're scaring your sister.
Okay.  So he was tall?
What did you say?
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
You're in here for winging a guy?
What friend is that?
There's nobody coming?
Your next water ain't for three days.
All right then.  Let's go.
Where were you?
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
Which way do you mean?
He is that.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
I understand.
You haven't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
Anybody got any ideas?
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Who is he?
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
Is that a fact?
You're kidding.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
What makes you think I could?
Because they enjoy it.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Good-bye, Paden.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Why'd you go into business with him?
I thought you two would get along.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
I'm glad we talked.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
Excuse us.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
The picture's dead.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Even the fall from the plane.
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
No... it's life.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
I have to talk to her.
Of course.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Is that a problem?
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
And what may I ask brought this on?
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Why not?
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
I'm sorry.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
What's that?
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
If anyone asks about Simone --
-- I know, I don't know anything.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
She looks a lot like you.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Taller, Viktor.
Taller?  What?
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
The only real truth is in the work.
I was hoping you'd say that.
--Do I know you?
I knew there was a sound explanation.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
You're a doctor. What kind?
No.
No.
Why?
That I'm a freak.
Something I want?
What?
Yes.
Me too.
Yes.
Yes, it did.
Standing next to my window.
Stop it!
Meaning?
You're standing in horseshit.
Could take a little while, though.
See?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Which street corner?
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Hey. Fuck you.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Hi Suze.
People say he was a murderer.
I --
So?
It's you. You and your father.
Never.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Like your guitar break.
What'll we do?
Sorry.
Whatcha' doin'?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Do it.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
Having fun.
I give up.
By stealing my car?
Yeah.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Yeah?
Bandit II?
Well, thanks for the lift.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Another time.
How'd you know?
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Bandit?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
What's your twenty?
Bandit?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Let's boogie.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Now, you just find him, son.
Yes, sir.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Is your security team armed?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Mortal.
Pretty much, yep.
Mmm-hmm.
You woulda?
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
-- You can and you will.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
I wouldn't go that far.
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
What!?
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
No, she won't.
Why would you let her to do that?
How?
Told you what?
To who?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Not necessarily.
To calm your anxiety.
I wasn't.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
You don't know?
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Thank you.
You never said you wanted one.
Chris --
I want you here.
But then I would be dead now.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Am I really her?
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
No, Ma'am.
I came on at 8:00.
No dog.
But "nice".
Very nice.
Tell it like it is.
You asked.
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Are you okay?
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
"For"...?
You take care.
You're planning to speak?
Sure we are, let's go!
My ass is falling.  It is.
You don't want to hear about it.
Where'd you get the tie?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
Yes.
Be nice.
I'm always here, Pete.
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
What if you get hurt?
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Well, no.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
No…
Like it?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Phooey on that.
Plenty.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all good Nazis?
Looks good outside.
Static!
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
So long, Sefton.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Why not?
No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
You won't get off that cheap.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Me? What if she don't want me?
You're teasing me again!
No?
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
You did?
She'll never forgive me!
Bombs away!
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Why, sure!
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Why the south latrine?
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
Fine -- fine!
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Russian women prisoners?
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
Where is he?
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
Twelve years, sir.
Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Population?
Commander.
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
I hope so, sir.
On screen.
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Wherever he wanted to be.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
That's right.
I hadn't planned on it.
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
All right, all right. You've made your point.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The Nexus.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Aye, sir.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
I have already made one transmission too many...
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Do you have an explanation?
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Just him, sir!
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
You would have done the same for me.
She's to be decommissioned.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Close... There --
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Torpedoes coming in -- !
Who is this?! How dare you --
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Yes, I was...
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Then, how --
Of course...!
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
What I have done, I had to do.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Success, my lord.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
All true.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
That's all you have to say?
I'm not a drama critic.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Ah.
I can spare me...
It's like the Garden of Eden...
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
We encoded four minutes --
They're still running with shields down.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Visual --
Inoperative.
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
Aye, sir --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Or the one.
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
They just don't want us going in there.
Aye, sir --
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
Ready, sir.
Never, sir.
Aye, sir.
The question is irrelevant.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
What do you mean?
Cramps.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Well nobody's perfect...
I was not informed about observers.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Go ahead. Stun me.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
You're upset about losing the whales.
All right. The truth?
I'm all ears.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Whales?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Yes.
Why not?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
Will it?
A perfect moment?
I thought it might begin the healing process.
I'll be here.
You're what?
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Bye.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown.
From the mission...
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Another time.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Thank-you for reminding me.
... had regenerated.
On screen.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Remind me to lodge a protest...
No, we're here to... rescue them.
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Beam him out!
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
You should feel right at home with them.
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
I look forward to reading your report.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Are you saying they won't help us?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
At least four hours.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
I do not know what you are referring to.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Can you configure it?
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
How did you know about that?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
We?
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Life signs?
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
No, sir.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Now there's a poser.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Barely.
You feign ignorance?
He just tried to save him!
I am.
Your honors, the State rests.
Uhura, monitor!
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Kill him! He's the one!!
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
Candidate for what?
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
I always wanted to try that.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
Confirmed, Captain!
Would they?
Aye, aye, sir.
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No.
You're working late.
Not tonight, I have work here.
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
How can you be sure?
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.

You're speaking of emotional investment?
Make it so.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Thank you, Commander.
What do we know about the population?
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Aye, sir.
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Still well on our side...
A coup d'etat?
No?
I've never met a human woman.
I have dissolved the Senate.
Yes.
I know.
What happened?
I have no reason to.
All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
Runs in the family.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Now go. I have some personal business.
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
I don't see anything.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
I make maps.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Dashboard.
Good.
That way.
I know.
My... husband.
I am husband?
It was yellow.
You better.
How will I do this one?...
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Three nights... two days.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
A baby is a new person?
What is hitchhike?
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Please stay.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
What is hell?
It's bad.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You don't forget anything, do you?
I understand.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
What will you say about us?
I will say that we can be friends.
No.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
I did.
I know, but...
Yes.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
No.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
You know that's impossible!
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
Maybe later.
You talked to Iris?  When?
He has his uses too.
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Sorry.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Strickland.
Sleaze to peddle.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
You will not live to see the morning.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
It's not your fault.
But that doesn't add, does it.
Jesus, Mace!
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
Fire's out, isn't it?
Well, look at the plus side.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I guess.
No.  It didn't.
See you downtown.
Are you going to make me beg?
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
No, sir.
Who knows.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
A grill pattern.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Please.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
Doesn't fit.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
You got a point there.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
What did you tell him?
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
Suspect Zero.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
All the same killer?
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
No weapon.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
Yes, sir.
It was the mall.
Maybe you should back off.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
[You tell me.]
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
Speck is dead.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
You have to put things in perspective.
You've been through worse.
You're right. I know.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
I'm Mike.
Like the quiche?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
To do what?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
What else is going on?
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
...And she's with someone else.
Could you believe it?
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
Yeah. And an actor.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
Hi, Mike?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Why didn't you call?
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
So I don't call either way.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Why?
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
I didn't mention her once today.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Bud.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
...People get carjacked...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Who's the big winner?
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
I gotta use the phone.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
No, baby. You're money.
Yeah, a good friend.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I just need some time...
...It looked money.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
A day.
What was cold about it?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...shivering...
...You're just poking at it...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Yes. 
Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Godfather.
Barzini.
I'm not hungry yet.
Like hell I will.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
You understand him better than anyone.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Yes.
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
What is it?
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
Beautiful all over, eh?
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
That's for you to find out.
Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Mike, why am I out?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
Michael...
Then the legs at the knees...
He's coming over here!
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Please say it.
I can help you out...
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Do you recognize my voice?
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Did you speak to my father?
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Say again?
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
I have to go to Venice.
I played piano in a few places.
Copy out from here...
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Why?
Tom, I don't love you.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Dickie?
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Have you done something to your hair?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Such as?
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
I think you're right.
You were going to Venice.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Dickie did it.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
What?
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Oh Marge.
No glasses.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Is Freddie in Rome?
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
What rumour?
That's good, isn't it?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Postmortem?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
What about Thomas Ripley?
What about Ripley?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Yes?
I can believe that.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
The DMZ?
That would have been quite a coincidence.
What?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
I bought a couple of tickets.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
My God!
Hello, Betsy.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Well, I hope he wins.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Oh, Tom, please.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
Ouch!
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
What is it? I'm busy.
No, I'm serious, really...
The kind with a brush.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
And what happened?
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
I don't like my real name.
Don't you understand anything?
I can leave anytime I want.
Where is home?
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Yes I am.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
Damn straight.
Got your license?
Age?
Twenty-six.
Sure.
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Take it or leave it.
O.K., cowboy.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
The taxi life, you mean.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
You know how I feel about what you do.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
Don't let him do that.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Delly?  In here.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
It's possible.
I do?
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
And why not?
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
I'm not refuting anything.
Well, son, you're home!
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
By all means.
What's that?
Good to meet you.  Again.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
A super market.  Huh.
Can't wait.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
You bet.
Anybody take it?
Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Why not?
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
Nineteen-oh-nine.
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
No, I...
Oh.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Actually, it's none of my business.
Yes.
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Yes?
When was this?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then why did she object to you?
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Just listen to them!
Your brother told me.
I don't think your mother would like that.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Try my best.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Mmmm.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
The little girl's name.
I need her exact name, you see.
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
A what?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
She was selling birds.
Yes, Mother.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Did you close the door?
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Well, I...
I'm awfully sorry.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Yes?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Right next to the one you already had.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Seven o'clock then.
He was watching a ball game on television.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I do different things on different days.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Are you staying?
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Santa Rosa?
You said three o'clock.
And he'll talk?
Well, all right, but...
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
These weren't a few birds.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
Can't you please finish your drink?
Good.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
I'm cold as ice.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
I remember her.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
I wanted to see the white horse --
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
You will not have it?
Why don't you do it then?
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
But what makes a thought start?
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
This is a gift.
Get out of here!
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
What did you hear?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What did they give you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
You killed that cop Dutton.
Yeah, I know.
Shut up.
I know.
You mean Alex.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
It still doesn't mean...
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
No -- I'm afraid not.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
You must have come a long way.
About 250 million of your miles.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
You know about the United Nations?
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
Thank you... Have you any news?
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
Where is the meeting going to be?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
But I suppose you know the answer.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
He's my brother.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
<u>Four</u> to go.
What?...
Why?  They're only noodles.
Where's Star, David?!
For a ride.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Sam, don't --
I like Michael.
You better not like him too much.
I'll hitch.
Gotta go, Mom.
Michael!...
Can we get a T.V.?
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
I hope so.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Because I love you...
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Entertain yourself.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Just listen.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Watch Clark.
Cool it, Palmer!!
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Hell no.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Cut him loose?
The dogs?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
What?
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
A day or so ago... I guess.
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
I'll put this right through your head.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Damn if I won't.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
We going to make it?
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
Anyplace but here.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Well, let's get down there.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
What kind of stories?
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
I'm used to that.
Send him away.
Yes... Thank you.
Why did they built it?
How are your dreams now?
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
I need to... um... talk to you.
Talk away, Professor.
Hold on... I know I have it...
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
Let them.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
What?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Yes...
Mm.
You can see so many here.
Yes.
What's it all for?
How do you decide?
Learning was important?
You know this?
You lost someone.
If you only knew...
It's undamaged?
Yes... I suppose so.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Tell him to go away --
I see.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
I took a different route.
Why?
They're inside --
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Should we be...
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
In where?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
My business?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
Maybe it's not such a waste.
They should just be looking harder.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Sure.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Why?
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
I don't know.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
It's Sunday.
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
How?
I could try to...make it stop.
You thought my father was crazy?
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
You told me this was how it happened.
You have nothing to fear, William.
What are you talking about?
Good.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
[Beat] How do you know?
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
I'll manage.
[Beat] Why?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
What.
Yes, baby?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Christ, sure... yes!
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
What?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
Isn't this fun?
Get the car!
Give me the keys.
You're not touchin' that car.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
I don't know.  I won't be.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I won't wait up.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
No.
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
I... I...
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Well, you got it now.
Thelma!
About how fast was I going?
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
You know why.  You already said.
What?
I said all that?
Whatever.
Yes, Thelma?
We can live in a hacienda.
You're drivin'.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Yup.
How long do you think that'll take?
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
The thing's kind of heavy.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
He implied it.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Yeah, but he was successful.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
And this adversely affects me how...?
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Mints?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Mary.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Big time.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
Same here again.
By the way, what's your name?
Some buildings I'm working on.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
No, I mean
-- He's in a cage?!
A surprise?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
Have you seen it?
A fucking moron.
What?
Come on, what were you going to say?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Forget it. It was... fun.
You don't buy what?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Answer the question, shitball.
How'd you manage that one?
Nice.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Fucking sickening.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
What?
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're too hard on guys.
What's a mook?
Why?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, it's an old football injury.
Are you all right?
Just a minute.
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
Trying to be.
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Teddy, be brave.
Oh God.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Where the hell are you?
What if I can't?
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
We can't do that, Bobby.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
Cuba.
Then they should speak up.
Yeah.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Not as far as the election goes.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
I don't care. Cancel it.
I don't know. I don't know.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
Seven.
Jesus...
I already did.
How'd you know?
I got one up on ya.
Let's see it.
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
He saw an owl.
I don't see the connection.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
I desecrated it?
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
No. No, no. Thank you.
-- your father was part Sioux.
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
Get up!
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
That's a big comfort to me.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
How did you know this was my car?
I saw one.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
It's classified.
Where were you?
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Two miles.
There you go with those moves again.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
How about anything, anything you want to do.
What plane.
Anything.
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
. Yeah!
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Not to me.
What kind of games?
I like to play "reality".
True.
Who's gonna win?
I hope you find him.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Well?
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
What is he doing?
You.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
Did what?
So's my Johnson.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Just once, if they take your plane away.
I've had enough...for now.
I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
That's because you don't have any women.
IT'S MY SHOT.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
I like that in a fighter pilot.  It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
All right.
No bother.
I'm nothing like him.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
The Last Resort.
You're getting off to an early start.
Take me to the hotel.
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Sleazy...and demure.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
Are you saying she liked it?
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
I don't know.
Tell me!
Move to Mars.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
They did!  But I killed them!
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Mars.
Right.  Mars.
How real does it seem?
I think it's still hungry.
I guess he didn't.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
...Who are you?
Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
Roger that.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
I think I scared it!
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Do not talk to the driver.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
That's the plan.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
A man who plans ahead.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
So noted.
I can describe it.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
You fucking swear to shut up!
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Right. You're right.
I specialize, Roger...
-- an angel dust dealer --
Chinatown street gang.
"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool.  Next exit.
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
I'm not that desperate.
I haven't paid you.
"Painted"?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
What went down?
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
This and that.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
No? Then what did he say?
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
-- Every word.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
For control of the prison drug trade?
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
I want you to kill for me.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Well, where are you going?
An old woman and her grandson.
Did she have someone with her?
Oh.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
What?
Anything else?
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
Thanks.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
No.
Bob.
No... No...
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I'm so sorry, Laura.
Let's go all the way.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
Everything, but everything.
When he finds out.
No.
Sex?
I understand.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
It's a school night... back by nine.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
As if I didn't know.
There's no one here.
What did he find?
Yes.
How did you settle on the amount?
Mickey told me to come back to work.
Gruber...
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
What does it mean?
You would not...?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
How is that?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
You may step down.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
That's what I'd planned to...
...What difference would...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
The Doctors were not negligent.
I... um...
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
You're going to settle out of court?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
Four. You're great with these kids.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
And what are you? A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
And are they going to get it?
I...
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
And what makes you so tough?
Is there going to be a later...?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Call the A.M.A.  ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
No.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
I've got nothing to say to you.
Nothing happened.
It's locked?
...I understand...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Uh...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Admittance form is wrong.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Right.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Today is Tuesday. What?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The Hospital...?
Yes.
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
It was...  ...one of them!
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
No.  I thought you had them.
It's always been a good persuader.
They'll probably move at dawn.
It was nearer than that.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
So?
Like weird calls, by any chance?
These look quite fresh.
They were safe and could sleep.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
I want to see for myself.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
What's that?
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
Uh...sure...when?
Yep.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Yeah.  How'd you do.
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
Me either.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
I gotta go.
Me too.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Good.
I just brought you something to eat.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
It works?
I can't make it out?
What are you talking about.
All stop on the engine.
Face what?
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
They have every right Chuck.
I don't know.
So is violating international law.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Shut up donut.
Trust me donut.  I know.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
Outer.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
It hurts too much to care.
About anything.
I'm sorry...
Aaauuuhhh!!!
I can't be sure.
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
I am accountable.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Why? He's right in the groove.
We don't have no paper bags.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
You an indian?
Lula tell you she's pregnant?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
That's right... Take one of these.
No shit?!?! You know him?
Used to.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
What's the name of it?
Whattaya do there?
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Hasta siempre.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
And?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
And you never told nobody about it?
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Here she goes again...
What happened to him?
Hell, peanut...
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
They sure do stink.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
What's that, peanut?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
I'm goin'.
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Under a hundred.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
If you say so.
You think she's gonna make it?
You sick?
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
Oughta make 'em happy.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
What could I be up to, Lula?
Lead the way.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
Just a place.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Get rid of him?
Santos...
Yes.
So?
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Actually... I just want to go home.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
No. Not yet he isn't.
Not Curtis.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Because... because...
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
So whose car is it?
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
I peeked.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
No. There's no one here.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Who's got a gun?
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Stop calling me Vernon.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Yea?
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
So what are you doing out here?
You're right.
This is worth it.
That's really it.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Yea, James.
You?
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
There is, but it's not that interesting.
The guy on the phone.
When we fall, we fall hard.
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
Jealous? Of me?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
When nobody's looking.
Okay.
I'm a little worried, James.
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
Grady!
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Who does?
That good, huh?
No, it's not that, it's...
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Did you confess?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Are you sure you parked it there?
And what do you think you might have said?
I know.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
I'm your man.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
You want to keep him happy.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
It's a nice table.
No thanks.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
There's a million birds here.
Is that right?
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
It's a bright sound.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Yeah.
You can't talk to me like --
Okay.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Little Red Riding Hood.
No.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
I count my blessings.
'Fraid not.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Are you sure?
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
They sound like finches.
Does he?
Yes.
I can't.
Your daddy will always love you.
It's getting dark. Go home.
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I said I was sorry.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
I see my sister.
We're little kids.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
It's fucking freezing out here.
Yeah, you.
I'm just quiet.
Neither do you.
What about them?
What?
Do you?
It's been a while since...
Maybe later.
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
The worst?
Twelve years in prison?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
Prove it.
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
I'm switching off now.
What happened?
Fine.  Be that way.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
What do you think he saw?
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
I don't know how!
FUCK LOGIC!!
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Who then?
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Wait for what?
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
But you just said that a month was too...
What! After giving us such a run around...
But how could you say such a thing?
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
As you wish.
That seems to apply to you also...
And why haven't they left each other?
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Oh, Sandro...
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
And what about you?
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Okay. In a few minutes.
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
I'm too sleepy.
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
I don't love you.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
It couldn't be any clearer.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Ask her.
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
I don't see why I should mind.
Lady Patrizia!
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
He talked to you Himself?
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
He loves you the way you are.
Who tells you these things?
That's not what he meant.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Why?
Dear Jesus...
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
That wasn't me.
Let's talk about something else.
Yes.
Everyone.
Something I ate.
And what did you do?
From their heads...
Where'd it come from before that?
No.
I could never be a mother.
Agnes...
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Agnes...
Answer me!  You never answer me.
I'm always bad.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
Yes.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Yes.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I wasn't worthy.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
I can't tell you that.
She made me promise not to.
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Are you ill?
I don't know which one 
Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
Who?
How did she know about him?
Who?
She took the baby in her arms?
You saw it all didn't you?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
I don't know.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
When?
It's your favourite...
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
Yes... I...
You can call me Sister.
Unfiltered.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
None as far as I know.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
The Catholic Church...
Earthquakes?
Visitors to the convent.
Oh, Dear God...
Your niece!
Because I didn't know... 
I haven't decided yet.
You just said...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Fine thanks...
Do you think they ever existed?
Yes I do.
Then let's begin.
She's been touched by God, yes.
She is an innocent.
That's a lie.
Then she's a liar.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
I'm a deserter.
Just you?
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
I've made the scene.
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Is he?
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Are you pulling my leg?
Gear?
What's that mean?
What are you?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Is she?
And cunning.
You can learn from books.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Books are good!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
You're only right.
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Clean though, isn't he?
Like what?
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
We were going to do it.
Oh you are, I know you are.
Thanks.
Don't exaggerate.
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
Shurrup, cheerful.
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Is that you, Roby?
Yeah, it's you all right.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
That's what I'm going to do.
Gravity?
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
I'm on my way.
You want to try?
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
A voice transmission.
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
What do you mean?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Is it alive?
Damn it!  How long to fix?
What?
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
I hope not.
Right. 
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it.
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
Good.
It's time for drastic remedies.
Right.  We've got a lot to accomplish.  Let's get moving.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
I've completely lost their signal.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
We can use the flamethrower.
What's the frequency?
Sun will be down in a minute.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Are they close?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Found what?
Is that its mouth?
Even simple.
Now what?
I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
No... don't...
I told you we... what's that?
Thanks.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
Forget it, man.
What?
Just behind us, over to the right.
Yeah, I...
Where does that lead to?
What?  Why?
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Only six?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
I... I can't!
You got it, cowboy.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Yes. The Shubert.
Eddie...
D-day.
We're?
Lloyd and I.
You have no right to say such things!
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I never intended you to be.
I can't believe my ears...
Why not?
It's the same thing, isn't it?
You're being childish.
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
Margo.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Where's my coat?
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
And cut that out right now.
When - when are you coming back?
You in a hurry?
She did...?
Okay.
What?
When I'm guest of honor?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
Now don't get carried away-
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
Hear, hear...
What would you like? Texas?
Why you have to go out there.
I just asked a simple question.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
So am I.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
- and for you.
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
What did you expect - live sables?
Oh, brother.
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Oh-oh.
No.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Oh, no. I see the play.
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
He can help you.
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
Not at all...
Of course it is.
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
No trouble at all.
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
I've got it.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
They're your fans, your audience-
The heave-ho.
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
Roughly ten minutes.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
Well... all right.
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
Incredible.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
Not much.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Where is she?
When you do, let me in on it.
Don't be evasive.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
You'd have been proud of her.
That's beside the point.
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
What's your being married got to do with it?
But that was the fourth straight time.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Would you?
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
Well...
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
I was sure trying.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
--I'm trying--
Anything you've got.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
--I know, I know--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
Who?
It's nothing personal, though. 
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
--Howard Hunt?
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
And you will.  But not now.
--so?
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
--you don't really think you're being followed?
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
Something maybe big.
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
--I'm not here.
OK.
Look, I told you inside--
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
To where?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Will you step forward, sir. 
Where?
The C.I.A.
--quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
Who's Colson, Harry?
Howard--
That was awhile ago.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Sorry.
...okay...
I'm not good in math.
Neither did I!
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Why is this?
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
You can call me Oz.
How did you know I was here?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
This isn't any better, Chris.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Then what the hell are you talking about?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Dad, come in.
Okay, well that about covers it.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
After getting laid?
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
Kevin, this is serious!
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
It did.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
He didn't?
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Also like sex with my wife.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
Yeah. Apparently.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
No it isn't! You're dead!
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
What?
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
A la votre.
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
Oh no... no....
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Claude.
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Why would he pick this one?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Double merde.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
I'm fine.
Yes, your highness.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
No!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
Watch me.
No. Empress, you --
I should go
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
I did no such thing!
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
What's your name?
Come on.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
It's okay.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
M'm.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Well, then, w-who was?
Me? Oh, downtown!
Well, where is it? I-
Okay, that's good.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
And I love what you're wearin'.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Uh, narcolepsy.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, huh?
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
What?
Yeah.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
What? What?
H'm?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Those are the two categories...
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Were you always funny?
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Yeah.
I didn't follow you!
Following is different. I was spying.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
David? You call your teacher David?
M'hm.
M'hm.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
No.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Very big spider.
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, I had the radio on.
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Remember that day?
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
What?
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
I did.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I can't.
I can think of another word.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
Oh, do yuh?
Trigger.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Ah.
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
You'll total the whole car.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
M'hm.
There are no twos, Max.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
She was going through my pocketbook!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
I look pretty.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Oh, gosh.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
And how's the diva doing?
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
October-ish.
To dander.  Otis.
I'll change back before we leave.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
It's not going to come up.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
I never put myself in harm's way.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
And?
Leave us alone right now.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
I don't think so.
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Probably not.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
I'll say as little as possible.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
You don't have to.
It's a Calder.
Ah...
Oh, you know, I am.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Don't I find what?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Joking.
Sally did all this herself?
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.
Trust him.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
I don't need a drug.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
Are you working on a new book?
I so wish I'd known.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Like your business managers?
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
Okay.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Evie has a little something for you.
Like Joe.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Tell me about it.
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
I'm Princess Bala.
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
I order you to find out where we are!
Want a list?
Wait, I hear something!
You held onto this all that time?
Yes...he's wonderful...
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Alright, let's move out!
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
I can't think of any.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
I sort of like it.
That makes me feel just terrible.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
I forgive you.
Much better.
He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Let me help you.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
What's your friend's name?
Something wrong with your legs?
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Give what up?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
A cemetery?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Sure.
Who'd care?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
No -- just come as you are.
Fine. How's your eye?
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Gas?
Yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
The Vice Squad?
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Put me down for Thursday again.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
You're going to take her off my hands?
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Slow down, kid.
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Just as long as she's okay.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Well, you can't win 'em all.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Not particularly.
You got a girl-friend?
I'm with you, lover.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Yes, I know.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I want you back, Fran.
We talked about a lot of things.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Now, Fran --
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Don't you ever stop talking?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Lovely. You were a big help.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
I like all of them --
Sit down -- we'll talk about it.
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Sure, thanks.
North ?
Yeah.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Why they call you that?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
A sauciere --
I don't know.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
Looks that way.
Who's he?
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
... he's an amazing officer.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Who knows what's up there?
Who knows? Right.
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.
A lame ?
About what ?
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
How big it is?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
When did you hear?
The trees, eh...
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
Yes.
How's the pain?
I can handle it.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
Both of us...
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
You think?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
168  CONTINUED:
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
Had?
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
I'm right behind you.
Forget it.  It would take days.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
You don't feel cold?
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
You don't know how true that is.

You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Let's get out of here.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Uh-huh.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Okay.
What do you care?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Sorry.
Just how grateful I am.
Okay.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
I can't. I work.
No.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Okay.
One baked -- one fries.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
I'll never forget you said it.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
The two might go together.
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Absolutely.
Thank you for walking him.
Oh, my gosh.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Yeah.
What?
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Okay, don't.
Sounds like chickenshit --
Do you want Rath or not?
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
It cost us.
He stole another contract.
Yeah.
Now you understand why I'm here.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
Why?
He was killed.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Why not?
The exotic women.
Why not?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Because you are a women.
Tell me about the first time.
My first take?
Why?
Are they usually like that?
They become complicated... messy.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Good.
Thinking.
Work.  The things I need to get done.
Thank you.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
I was.
For Nicholai?
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
What did he say?
You didn't take it.
No.
So?
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
I'm sure you will.
Attraction is a complication?
It happened to you before?
She was taken.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Uh-huh.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
I thought it was interesting --
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Honesty.
A dime.
Taken.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
What are you thinking about?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
Yeah.
American currency.
Never heard of K-MART?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
Close!
So why didn't we?
When your ready Son!
Both, see you later.
What happened to Katka?
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
Damn!
Did you see anything in the files?
What do you want me to do?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Yes.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
Whatever!
You're everything a guy could want.
What? You are crazy!
Don't worry it's okay!
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
What for?
Insurance!
You mean it's started?
Thanks.
What's the Bugler?
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Guests.
I'll need to make a phone call.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Yeah.
No problem, is it at your place?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Why?
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
And what of these foreigners?
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
I'll tell her you were here.
About a job.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
You sleeping with her?
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
-- This your idea of small talk?
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
This play -- ?
And you have to meet my father.
You think so.
Could be...
That would be the reason.
You don't know what you want --
And why would that scare me?
I heard what you did. Thank you.
I wanted this to be a date.
It's only 7:30.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Twice a year.
Where?
Mars.
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
That I want you to take me home.
Tired.
Better. I was really angry.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Like what, sir?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
How -- how long does she have?
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
Yes. You?
Getting by.
Yes.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
When do I get time for me?
You don't. That's the point.
Thank you.
Yes, sir!
Uh, yes, sir...
Uh, hi....
You do?
Well... yeah...
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break!  I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
Shhhhhhhh!
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
A mall?
Of course! The power converter! It works! Of course, it works...  What chemicals do we use?
We don't....
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Professor, be serious, would you?
Well, it was there.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
What theater was I at?
What? 
What do you feed him?
Sure.
What'd you come out here for?
Yeah.
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Well, stop the world.
Well, I got homework.
Bring it along.
I know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
You said that once already... Too late now.
I don't blame him.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
No.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Yes?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
It's mine all right.
Just gimme a chance.
Git.
New Jersey?
Then that's it!
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
Let her out. In my custody.
Everybody okay up here?
Who?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
She was killed, Penny.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Absolutely.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
I have a radio fix...
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
How about you? Will you be alright?
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
...Who is this?
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
Go ahead, son.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Yes... Isn't it?
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
Ready... wrestle!
A little lift, yeah...
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
Yeah, but –
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me – I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
We gotta call the police –
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
...Yes, thank you.
Mr. Lipnik.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Anyway.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
We got a treatment on it yet?
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering – I thought we were together on that.
Yeah.
She was there, wasn't she?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Thank you.
What was she like in school?
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
Put your hands up!
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
You know all about me.
There's a name from the past.
She wiped out her whole family.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
My wife used to call me that.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
Fine.  How's your back?
It hurts.
Did you miss me?
No.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
No thank you.
Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How?
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
How's that?
Routine.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
I'm going with you.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Is he dead?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
You don't even work on your stuff!
That's good. At least they're interested.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
I hate this. Turn that off.
Yup.
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Still not here.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Oh yeah..
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Your people.
Oh man! Folklore guy – worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
I guess you did.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
It's Monday morning.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
Hi.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
Uh-oh!
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
That's ignorant.
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
No, actually I feel worse.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
You're not the Mayor.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Well that's a ... long story ...
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Nope, I told her everything.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Was.
One way to find out?
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
All is shrill, all is blight...
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
And a very, very good one.
Eventually she married a young physician.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
You'd be surprised.
Be ready for anything.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
But soon...
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
But he's never said a word-
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Like hell you do.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Our work?
Well, I can respect your opinion.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Why, indeed?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
Mystery.
Enigma.
How ya doin', Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
We'll talk some other -
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Rinka.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
I'm not-
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
I got family. ...Please.
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
And what happens if we say no?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Yeeees?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Ahm.....
What?  What?
Ahm.... .
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Ahm....
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
How the hell should I know?
Okay.....
I am sorry you feel that way.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Uh... Uh...
Heh heh. Thank God.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
You'll be rich!
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
... Hmmm?
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
What makes you think she likes me?
3:30 I guess.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
You don't kill anyone.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Can you scare them off?
We tried.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Life is just... too awful.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
You've got to help them.
He's your cousin.
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Just don't tell Lydia.
... sheets.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
I cannot believe this.
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
Attic space.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Why not?
Their wedding clothes.
But not for long...
Yes, Robert. I will.
It's fine today, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Oh, really?
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Yes.
Yes. Thank you.
No. I like it here.
I am a very good gardener.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Fine. He's very nice.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
I like to watch.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Hello, Morton.
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
So you know Krylov!
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
I agree.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
... Sir?
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
It's very sore.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
I'm going to work in the garden.
Thank you.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
I live here.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Do you feel well enough for that?
Hello, Sophie.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Look, Johanna...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
No problem, Chief.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Oh? What?
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Malkovich!
Yeah, okay.
Which one is Elijah again?
We have to make it an early night.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
Fuck Maxine.
Me and John.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
People make mistakes.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Yes?
Yex?
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
Yessir.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Is that true?
I wouldn't know.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
Yeah.
Why not?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Just.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Ha ha ha!
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Do you?
Count me in.
Oh, be still my heart.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Who needs dancing?
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
Then what do I do?
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
Say the Word!
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You still know.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
I will.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Better ask Paul D.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Till she showed herself.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
That's so.
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
For what?
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
She was only-
Yeah. Look bad?
She left me. She's gone again.
She was my best thing.
Make it the way I always do.
Yes sir.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Why me, man?
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Yeah, it sucks.
Nothing.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
I am the Walrus.
I'm going home, Donny.
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Uh-huh.
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
In the briefcase?
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Separate incidents?
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Mm.
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude abides.
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Huh?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
I was talking about my rug.
Oh, no.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Take a look at this, sir.
A hundred.
And please don't call her my mother.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Dieter Hauff?
So Dieter has the money?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
What the fuck are you--
Okay. That, uh.
Huh?
Am I wrong!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Just for making the hand-off?
What if it's during a game?
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
Easy, Dude.
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.
That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Aw, fuck it.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
What about the toe?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And the fucking money!
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
Huh?
Yeah, and you were--
This driveway.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Yeah.
Walter--
...Us? DUDE
Yeah?
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Is this a--what day is this?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Someday.
Survival.
Time.
Fry 'em.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I'll show you.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Then who does he work for?
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
So?
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
He was here.  Watching us.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Maybe it's better that way.
Two so far.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You used me as bait?!
The way they move, they way they smell --
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
Cancer.
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
He is an abomination!
You've been listening in the whole time?
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
What do you mean?
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Yes.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
Think again.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
You sure?
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Anna--
I don't know.
--bullshit!
--Cotter's--
--you should get back into bed.
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
--hours before--
I can't.
No.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Fine.
Never would've guessed.
Butt-ugly owl.
Still don't see it--
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
--I saw what I saw.
--turn the camera off--
--Graduate Thesis--
This isn't about us.
<u>What</u>?
Spite.
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
By day? No sweat.
--oh, Jesus--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
--it's less than four feet, just--
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
You planning on sleeping out there?
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
....I don't know.
That's the <u>reason</u>.
That's why she kills children.
Get some more beer.
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Yes.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Your husband.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
...Mm-hmm.
Ray?... What time is it?
Abby--
In the trunk.
We don't seem to be communicating--
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Most of the night...
Got a job for you.
It's not strictly legal.
Well what?
...What?
Jesus, I don't believe it...
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
Nah, I trust ya.
You said the usual--
Right. Sorry.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
It must be great.
Why do you do it?
Who knows you have these?
Yes sir.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Baby wants to fuck.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go for a ride?
You want to see him too, right?
Bull.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Oh yeah, that's good.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Lie down on the bed.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
No. please. I won't.
No.
No. What is happening?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Then don't talk about killing.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
What?
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
It's okay. it's okay.
They hurt his head.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Here's to Ben.
There ya go.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don't know. he moved away.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Yes. I do.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Oh, okay. can I call?
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
What is it?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Frank!!
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Alright.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Yeah, I know.
What?
He what?
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
We'll take it.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
No.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
Oh hey, one more thing?
No, my brother.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
But to the victor belong the spoils.
Try the back bedroom.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
I love you too, man.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
I did not.
Mexico.
Barbara.
Actually, it was three.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Not mad.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
She did that before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
I said, I've seen it before.
Better than you.
Dad.
You mean, like a trip?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
I didn't mean to...
Shhhh.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Okay, George.
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Who's the co-pilot?
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
The strike is a success; but ...
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
It depends on you.
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
The NLF has condemned you to death.
I'll explain.
Sure. By shooting at me.
Then don't complain.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Yes, a name for the operation.
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
I have.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Why did you come by?
No -- never.
What about Miss Lawson?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes.
I had bypass surgery.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Why not?
What happened after that?
Why?
-- And what did you suggest?
We had dinner at a restaurant.
No.  No, I don't.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Dristan nasal spray.
Three fifteen.
Yes.
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
We're not animals.
How?
Why didn't you live together?
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
You take a lot for granted.
You don't need anybody.
That's crazy.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
She allegedly humped him to death?
-- But it's Sunday.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
How often do you use cocaine?
I'm always open to learning new things.
Some example you set.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
It's not that long.
Come here a minute.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
You want me to call the doctor?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
And clean.
Yes. Very clean.
Much.
Is the dizziness gone?
I feel so embarrassed.
Okay.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
Why, do you think?
You sound like an artist.
What?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
No. But I love them just the same.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
What made you ask such a question?
I already apologized.
No. I was just... No.
I'll pick you up.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
What's her name?
Betty.
They're not going to find her!
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
So what the hell's the good news?
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
That's some terrible shit.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
I said, no thanks.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
Have you ever been inside?
All the more reason I should be here.
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Bill!  Bill?!
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
You was just doing your job.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
Shit, that was fast.
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Not that I remember.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Evidence of what?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
What's that, Johnnie?
The same way you did before.
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
They just left, didn't they?
That doesn't make any sense.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
But it could be anywhere.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
I should have let him kill you.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
I could be lying.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
No.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
Basically.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
I'm not afraid of anything.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
For what?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
Is that what you think?
I think ...
Good.
Yeah.
What happened?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
An accident.
Shit!  Oh shit!
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
I'm here, aren't I?
Pop?
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
What do they want me to do?
I don't know.
We have to go home, Jason.
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
Yes.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Did you?
I want to go home.
I won't hurt you.
I know that.
Listen to what you want.
Thanks for the ride.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
I guess so.
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
He came to kill us.
No.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I didn't know this would happen.
Nykwana Wombosi. 
xxxxxx
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
What?
I'm sorry.
xxxxxx
I tried.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
That'll solve all our problems.
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
What have you done to my flat?
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Oh, right ...
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
You are late.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Am I?
Not much.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Out of kindness.
And you're mine.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Trust me.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Why not?
Where are you taking me?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Who will?
Security.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Yes.  Come out, I know you're in there
Oh ... Jesus!
It's not our mistake!
But if they did promote you
The refund for Tuttle!
Tuttle?
Here.
You are good to me Sam.
Sam Lowry.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
You want to take my console into your office?
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
Mother!
Um ...
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
What? Who is this?
No need, sir
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Are you saying this is illegal?
Can you fix it?
What do they want you or?
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
I can't hold up my head anymore.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
No. He's dead.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
Did you see my father?
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
I think it looks good.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Maybe I should come up with you.
Promise you won't go inside.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
What do you think?
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
He was tough. You did all you could.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
I've taken that into consideration.
You okay?
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
That's ridiculous.
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
Don't push it, Larry.
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
You've made my dreams silly.
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Hold it down, okay?
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Why do you say that?
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
They're not that dumb, after all.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Did it really go well?
No!!!!!
This isn't friendship.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
Outside?
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
I'll never tell.
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Just a two-second dissolve.
Because...
No, I don't think so.
You talked me into it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
That's okay.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
It's Paul.
They fired me.
Okay, sweetie.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
One year...almost one year.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Yeah.
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
Good night??!
No.  Did he really?
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
Yes, I'm sorry.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
Not anymore!
I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
Yeah.
N-no...
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
I'll pose any way you want.
Is the manager cooperating?
Of course...it's wonderful.
What's it called?
Murdered man.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
It wasn't easy.
Sorry...
Are you ready?
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
What?
Is it?  I've forgotten.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Didn't you hear him?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Sure!
No...look I'm busy...
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
Good morning Walter!
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
Your work, the layers of irony.
You don't have to do anything!
Gee.  Thanks.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
Andy!
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
You didn't like them.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
You look like shit, Benny.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Eeyuu.
What's Bobby gonna say?
You were having a nightmare.
No, you didn't.  When?
Didn't you get my message?
Buffy.
Well, stay here tonight.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
You sure?
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
I'm glad you came.
Get away from me!
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
Get out of my facial.
Wait!
Time to do what?
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
She --
I have cheerleading squad.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Sporting events, yeah.
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Try to pay attention.
Not if you're careful.
How can you keep doing this?
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Really?
Could be.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
What is she...
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Hey, wait a minute...
Oh, please.
Right!
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Like you've got a grip.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Right.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
Catch?
Switch nostrils?
It's all the same thing.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Yes I do...
Oh--won't YOU come in?
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
What?
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
He looks great, just great!
Which one of us?
Oh both of you, of course...
Who's he play for?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Beg me!
You're a cocksucker!
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
Gimme that.
What do I got?
You been in the Majors?
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Fear and ignorance.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Take the first shot at me.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
I'm getting too old for this game.
Check it out.
Jim looking for somebody.
Looking for Crash Davis.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Well, I'd rather not say.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
You were never my guest?!
Was I at that dinner?
I can't do that.
Yeah.
Hey!
Mommy.
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
Hey.
No, of course not.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
No.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I lost control?
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Yeah.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
That's right, yeah.
No, a...
Well...
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
No problem.  Sorry.
Seven o'clock?
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
Yeah, refill'd be great.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
Why not make them happy?
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
Who's this?
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You're with me now.
You sure?
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
No.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
Okay.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
I gotta tell ya...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
What's it...
How serious?
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
Get out of here!
You threw it away?
What did Jennifer have?
Mm.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I should have -
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
Just wait there for me!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Not gonna let me in?
Let me in the house! Fucker!
How many kids do you have?
Eight children! 
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
No, Sir.
God! 
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
I didn't give 'em the m-
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
I'll to the FBI!
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
I did - I didn't -
Fuckers!
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
Uh-huh.
Calm down! Calm down!
We can't help him if -
But I'm just trying to leave.
It's in all the papers.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Are you sure?
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Hm.
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
Ma che cazzo!
That's enough now!
Fine.
Want me to take this for you? 
Okay, Sammy.
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
Bye.
You know?
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
All right. Be careful.
Well, you know...
Yes.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
It means I got the money.
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
They check in alone?
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Incredible.
Two.
Come here, come here.
What's takin' so long over there?
Pleasure.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Angelo and Buster.
They'll do it.
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Charlie M.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Again!
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
It's okay. Let her go.
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!
Winning.
I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
I know.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
You going to talk all day?
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Make a "U" and go back.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
Will you let me explain!
You're the one who's not to be believed.
My name is --
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
Stop throwing names at me.
What are you doing now?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
A price on everything.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
She's gone --
Don't say that.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Did you hear that click?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
You timed that beautifully.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
I thought it was inspired.
What's that supposed to me?
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
Did you hear that?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
That's how it's going to be.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Pass.
308-9962.
And not a nickel.
Don't worry.
There's two police cars now.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
In your dreams.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
From here on, I dish it out.
Yeah.
Whatever you say.
Nice.
I would expect he does.
Saw it, Dil.
You heard me --
Cunt.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Bloody right I do...
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
Must be.
How different?
Tell me about him.
Do I?
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
Do you care, Jimmy?
I said stop it.
You can always pretend.
Absolutely.
Should have stayed a girl.
Come on.
Kind of.
And you're not going to tell me more?
More than that.
It's a secret.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Sorry. What you doing?
For you...
I was trying to get out of something.
I will be.
Got to be somewhere.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Tell me what she wore.
You know her, Jimmy?
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
Horny bastard.
He's hot.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Yes?
Do you want a cup of tea?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
It's your decision.
I understand.
Good. So what do you think?
No fucking way.
They won't let him die.
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
Shouldn't take it personally.
Give us a break.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Doesn't matter where.
Do you?
What do you believe in?
What?
Yeah?
What does that mean?
No.
You won't run.
I said you bastard -- stop --
Got to catch me first --
Hurling --
Who gives a fuck.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
Oh!
You're going to look for him -- now?
Adam --
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
Where's that airlines bag?
I sure am. Get it.
Let's look anyway.
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
Don't be an idiot!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Then say it.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Because they're still here.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
Oh. Then who's this one?
Very good.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Starting with his own.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Okay -- up there.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Or you --  Or you --
Why you lied to me.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Who?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Leave me alone -- !
I'm very cold.
Where did he keep his money?
I know.  I'm sorry.
I wish you wouldn't.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
And this? And this?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Up there! I would put it up there!
I found it! I found it!
We won! We won!
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
Thank you.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
Having a nervous breakdown.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
How do you shave in there?
What was it?
What?
What?
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
How do you know what they're doing?
What are you talking about?
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
Yeah? What's that?
As fucking if.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Ok!
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
Calm down Brent.
It won't happen again.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
I thought you'd be pleased.
The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
She just turned off her light.
She's still a virgin.
She's not here.
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
Who's?
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
Sure.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
NO?!
What?
Mark invited me to the party.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I can't right now.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
What?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
I'm making you feel like meat?
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
I got to go.
Ok.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY.
Great. 
Art.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
He could've called first.
...ya?
Peace.
Shut...
...-er.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
Borrowed.
...the ice cream for money!
I ain't playin' that.
Okay, okay! 


...-er!
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Oh!
...man!
I think...
...we can make it.


Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
Come on, old Pete.
God, man!

I made it!
 I made it.
Shut up!
All right.
What?
Oh, no!
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
So I took his truck, yeah.
You know.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
...shit.
I mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
Hey.   Mason.
...or my conscience.
...man.
No. 

Reach into my pocket.
 Okay.

  I've got the real thing!
...our ass!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
It's working.
...-ta get outta here!

Look out.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...

Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
So...where's my truck?
...help you?
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
...take my sorry old truck.
We do need your truck.
Us.  Owe us. 
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
It's too...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Brynner.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
EXT. FORT LEAVENWORTH - TEN YEARS LATER - DAY.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/STORAGE AREA/FREEZER VAULT - NIGHT.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Check the immediate area.
I wanna patch in from...
...gear?
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
You try anything, it goes in...



 ...checked. 



 ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
Who's your suspect?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...that the prey can bite back.
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
...-lem?
...you answer mine.
...on the other end of this phone.
EXT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Oh yes.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Maybe.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Oh, my, yes.
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Tell her later.
You sure this is okay?
I've been wanting to meet you.
The apple core?
You're welcome to try. There he is.
No.
Where?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
What for?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
Yes.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
What?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
I'll stop by.
It wasn't much of a lie.
That your maiden name?
Over the water department, or over you?
Never forgave him for what?
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
They do in Chinatown.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
...A flaw...
I saw him.
Give me an example.
She's not tied up!
I am not!
Yes.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Don't know her. Take a number.
Okay.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
And Mulwray isn't?
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Yes?
Never?
It's not completely dry.
...Yes of course.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Since lunch.
He did or he didn't?
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
I'm working for his daughter.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats? 
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
Progress! It always arrives too late!
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
We'll talk about that later.
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
What does it say there?
Thais.
Go on!
I didn't see that.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
Sure, sure.
Who else did you see?
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
Is it good?
It isn't finished?
Of course.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
Toothache.
Hmm!
Thanks.
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
A rooster?
I work at Seligman's.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Would you sing for me?
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Susan!
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
Where'm I going?
People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Yes?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
What?
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
I know you will.
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
What do you mean by that?
Yes.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Was he in love?
Sure.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
I had a toothache.
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Unnhh!
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
Yeah, but not in here.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
Can I join in?
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
There's no light back there.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
And you said yes?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
You don't have anything to do with it.
Jesus, you're caustic.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
I left like an hour ago.
No.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
I wanted to use your car.
You win.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
What about Veronica?
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
I know.
I don't back down.
Because you buckled.
Sorry.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
It's today.
You hardly knew her!
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
If you go, I go.
Twenty-two; same as us.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Yeah, but at what a price.
I never tried it.
Just... go! Go open the video store.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
I want to rent a movie.
You want to rent a movie.
If you must.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Living proof.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Fuck you.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
I was born.
As if it's that easy.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Why do you say that?
What time did you get to work today?
You need a ride?
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
So.
Lasagne.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Jesus... go ahead.
I hate this fucking place.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
I was kidding.
How many?
You!
Yeah, right.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
How many dicks have you sucked?!
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Can I have your name please?
I didn't do that!
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
Yeah!
Well, how about these two movies? 
Screw you!
I... I don't know what to say.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
How yo doin', Gabe!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
That woulda been cool.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
Who's shooting?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Hey, fuck you.
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't expect you to understand.
A flare up...
And I can't leave.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
Hal knows what he's doing.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Excuse me?
Yeah?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
This rope is sixty years old!
Never
Do it, goddammit!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
You're looking at him.
Then it's a deal.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
What did you do that for?
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Yes. They want to help.
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
No, sir, I feel really great.
Good.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
I wanna be sick.
Crime?
Right. Take the cuffs off him, Mister. The cuffs are removed.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
No, sir.
You mean like going to the pictures?
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
Fine. Fine.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Oh.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
Yeah... Pete the English.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
You psychic?
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
The crowd had to dig it.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Who the hell is this?
Maaaaaax!
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Why not?
Max?  I'm Vincent.
You're cool.
I'm cool.
It's not me.
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Yeah.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I listen to classical.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
You go every night?
Don't start.
Yeah?  What happened?
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Makes two of us.
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
Head towards Union Station.
...indifferent.
What happened to you?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Who?
Shoot.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
How is it possible?
Is he dead?
Murdered?
What?
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Jerry, I --
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
This way.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
You saw me standing alone ...
You've never seen her run.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
I'm leaning toward no.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
A dog.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I don't understand.
Working.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
What do you suggest?
There's no plug to pull.
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
I'm willing to take that risk.
I disagree.
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Meaning...
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
You mean --
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Good luck, David.
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
How can that be?
Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
Okay.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
Now... you go home.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
No more stalling, Captain.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
Like it or not.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
Now you know.
Do you love your parents?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
But --
In other words.
Cut that backsass!
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Here, Mom.
Don't hit me! Please, for God's sake, don't hit me.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
You jes' watch us!
Pair'a nines.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
We got it locked in the sock.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Like an elephant.
What you mean, Luke?
Take it easy, Drag.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
You ever eat fifty eggs?
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
How about you tryin' to make me?
You ain't man enough to wear them!
You phony creep!
None of your fucking business.
What did I do?
Fear of what...
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Oh, I think you will.
No.  Not yet.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Who?
If he's not out, why are they here?
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
But it's a different m.o.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
You're afraid of him.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
Not yet.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
I know, baby.  I know.
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Who prescribes the brandy?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Look at her legs.
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Talk to Nikko...!
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
You're damn right I do.
We were together six years, sir!
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
Have you seen it?
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
You're not envious?
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
So - why the airport?
I work in the immigration department there.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
Patient.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
What about the engagement party?
Do you think I should?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Mom, please.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
Mottled really.   Green and red.
I answered these questions last night.
No way.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
I do.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
Coming.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
I don't feel like going to work today.
I'm going to the store.
I think you're overreacting.
Are you all right?
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
No.
Michael.   Yes.
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Who?
Oui.
And?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Half the tapes.
And the other half?
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
I'm going to kill him myself!
You're sure?
Has to be.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
Why haven't you turned us in?
Everything?
Everything.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
I see.   A master criminal.
This kind.
Relax. It will be fine.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
It's my idea.

Fuck you, grease-ball!
Wait here.
Glenmorangie is very good.
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
A little?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Okay.    Okay.
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Let's go!
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I owe you nothing.
Long.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You're probably right.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
Don't ever come back.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It has.  How's business?
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
It's time for me to leave it behind.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
But don't be too lenient.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Father!
What does it say?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
No onions?
Don't thank me.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Mister Funboy lives there?
Does she have a name?
A remembrance.  A closure.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
Well, how's your friend?
Do you know what you destroyed?
That's ancient history.
Another jolly nickname?
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Shut up.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
You heard me.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
I know.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Oh really?
You talking to me?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Thank you.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
How about tonight?
That's also none of your business.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Somerset Maugham.
Fine.
No.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Hi.
Yeah, me neither.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
German.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Absolutely.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Did you hide the letters?
Does your mother know?
Well... not exactly.
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
I am?
He'll love it.
I'm sorry.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Who told you?
And you think she bought it?
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
You don't mean?
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
I have a flair for drama.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
You will be discreet about this?
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Did you hit her?
You bastard!
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday — about Oliver's first marriage — and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy — although he'll never realize it.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
How?
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
On the back street — a green house
Are they nice?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
She was very pretty.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
Yes, darling,
Times have changed.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Well, it seemed to me --
What?
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
I didn't forget.
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
It stands so still.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
That's the clever way to do it.
Soon as I finish.
That means I can go alone?
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
But I only came to give back the ring.
Who is she?
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Anybody could know that song.
Now, I don't know Amy --
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
I've been working out.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
I wonder if he's married.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
No they're not.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
I haven't gotten it yet.
Did you get rid of Mark?
He's been here all night?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
I could smell another woman on him.
Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Fall in love.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
Well, whattdaya think?
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Since when do you care?
You never say that.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
Coffee and...
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
No?
There's a lot of that going around.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
No, I got it. It's okay.
What's that supposed to mean?
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Oh my god, what happened?
Tell her I'm eating.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
I told you she was innocent.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Not really...
He tried to kill me!
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
You are mistaken.
Just like that?
Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Yes, sir.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
What is that door?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Water?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Don't say a .
Is this dangerous or anything?
Great.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
And...
What do you mean, he's clean?
Nobody's got clean kids.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
Don't do this.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
And who's gonna find out?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Oh, yeah... probably...
I don't think so.
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Wrong...
He's not.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
`Bleed for your king.'
You're kidding.
No... They don't kid.
You don't change, do you, Bill?
Since when do you care about the homeless?
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
You made their funding disappear!
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
Oh... Okay.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
Just wait.
You find people jobs?
But you could go to jail for it.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
Hi.
I know.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Fabulous.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
The tunnel.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
That sounds like a curse to me.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
Don't come.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
Knox Overstreet.
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
Yep.
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
No.
What happened?
It's better than doing nothing.
Knox?!
No.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Then come with me.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
My Word
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
LOUDER!
All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
A madman.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Nothing wrong with research.
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Yeah.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
Good luck.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
I don't.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
I'll come to the performance.
Yea, art thou there?
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
How soon can we get up and running?
I told you...
With who?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Just trying to get to my boat...
Who asked you to!
You hear that?
I'm not rich people.
Anti social?
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
A meat locker.
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
You ain't giving the orders here!
So?
Forget them...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Me??
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
How does an island sound to you?
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
She fucked me.
You want 'em?
What?
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
I mean let's get going before --
Hey! Fuckin' A!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
It's Nick!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Where? Where is he?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
You talk to him?
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Everybody love Linda.
You mean...?
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
You know a guy named Merle?
Yeah?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Biederman, yes.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I don't know! I don't know either!
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
You're going hunting?
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Playing.
This is horrible!
Merle, I wanna go home!
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Fucking A.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son!
Pow.
Hell no!
Forget Sal?
More bullets in the gun?
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
Watch it, shithead!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
You didn't get a deer?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
That's who.
No.
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
I can smell it.
Wade's here.
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Telephone repairman.
I got it.  I got it.
But Sergeant...
Got it.  Ejection seat?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
Yes, sir.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Simulated one.

Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
Not yet.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
They always are.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
This little thing says I can't.
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
Guess there will, if it says so.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
-- in gold.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
The seventh day of April --
Look here now--
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
He was --
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
About what?
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
Headache -- Squire?
Well -- yes --
We can still use my butter money.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Mary -- how do you feel?
I'd love to.
There is nothing to worry about now.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
I don't know, Jabez.
Consarn the consarn --
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
It's all right, Sheriff.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
The past six months.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
I'll find someplace.
John.
How about his job?
John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
You don't want to know.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
Yeah.
Come on, what's under this?
Yes, I would.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
I love you.
How are you doing?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I'm really shakey.
Yeah.  So how are you?
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
What trip?
You're crazy.
What?
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Do you still want the operation?
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
Calm down, you're not ...
Yeah ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Give me the keys...
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
If you take anybody, please take me.
Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ...
No you don't.
I'm glad it's okay.
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
Pure?
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Does that still go?
Okay, Sonny.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
What can he do, he's clean...
Open this up!
... Just give me time to think...
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
I said you were never a faggot.
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...

No.  I don't work here.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Don't you bave a car?
I never thought of that.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Goulash.
I don't know how to make goulash.
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind.  But I like the dark gray one.
I guessed.
I don't understand.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
You met Basil Rathbone!
Oh, just like in the script!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Does she have room for me?
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
Yes?
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
You can't talk that way about my movie.
The marriage already ended.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
What do you mean?
No! I love sex with girls.
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
Bela died.
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Huh?!
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
Yeah...?
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
You're <u>sure</u>???
Mr. Wood!
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
At what point?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Went --
What?!
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
So?
What?
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
Leave her be.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
We're falling behind.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Mm.
Oh my God!!
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
And what did he come back now for?
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
St. Joseph's.
Ma...
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
She wouldn't tell me.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
I batted!
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Leave. Go.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
That's lucky.
Why?
... yeah, then, but...
No. Who?
Look at this.
So?
Where?
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Where were you?
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
What?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Screw off.
It's me, Ed.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Ray, come an--
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Hi.
No. Am I supposed to?
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
The pirate ship.
Good?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
How?
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
He likes it.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
What?
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Yes, I do.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Good for you.  Good for you
Sporty.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
This weekend.
And how did you get in the school?
Which door?
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
Well, I do.
I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
What do you mean?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Yeah.
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
What'd I do?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
I don't know.
How what, Wendell?
I got to write my report first.
What are you talking about?
It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
What was that boyfriend's name?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Which one are you and which one am I?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Against your code?
No.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
What little studio?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
I don't have time.  I have --
I don't own no shotguns.
And?
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
And now you'll provide them.
What's this all about, lad?
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
It's a simple question.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
What's her name?
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
You, me and White, huh?
When?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Sid, how are they hanging?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
And no one'll know about this?
Oh?  Anyplace else?
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Someone else?
Who are you calling?!
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Why?
Rachel Banks?
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Yes.
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
I don't know what that means.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
One-twenty.
I called my wife!
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
Why'd you leave?
The NSA killed him.
Them.
<u>Here</u>?!
You sure?
You're driving.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Goddammit--
Listen--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
How fast can you learn?
C'mon.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
A police report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
Listen to him.
You should take this seriously.
I saw a man die.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
Who did you work with to get the--
Have you been working with Rachel?
How could you let me find out like this?
Leave this house.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please.
The lingerie.
That's gonna end tonight.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
When do I get to meet him?
All right, look--
For the last four years.
You're wrong.
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
I have to go lingerie shopping.
Brill.
Who would do that?
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Yeah.
Alright!
They only took electrical appliances.
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Rachel's dead?
I don't know. I mean--
You're tired.
No, I--
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
What does that have to do with you?
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Lyle?!
Yes sir.
Explain that.
What about the tape?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
Puffed cheese?
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
Excuse me?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Will you please come in?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
When were you least happy?
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
Would you let me pass?
Dance with me.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
I was talking about the girl.
Which we've overflown twice.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
What if I told you he did this to me?
Please don't creep around this house.
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
I see.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Yes?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
You'd better be.

Thank you.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Yes.  Later.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
No.  He's - no.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
I had a hotel room.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Exactly.
How close?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
You can't.
Look on the back. What do you see?
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
It was a long time ago.
Charged?
Little celebration before we set off.
Something like that.
Get the hell in.
It's no good without the argon gas.
Call it a new tradition.
Four billion dollars.
FUCKING THING!!!
You can do it.
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
You are a miracle worker.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
She's calling the shots now.
You're giving them to me?
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Yes it does.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
What do you think?  What's this?
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
It's those files you asked for.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Yeah.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Bullshit, you don't.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Lemme see it, will you?
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
It's not about working hard --
Bullshit.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
No one's taking anything --
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
How do you know that?
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Yesterday.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I guess I did.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
You got more than one?
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
What's going on?
Yes.  It's called accountability.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
What?
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Everyone's invited, of course.
What's wrong with him?
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
I have felt it.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Does Luke know?
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
What is it?
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
Would you please stop calling me that?
You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
That's quite a compliment.
You mean a man you can control.
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
That depends.  Where are we?
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
I'm sorry too.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
And when do you betray us again?
That sounds familiar.
Oh my, no!
What did you say?!
Han's leaving?
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
My mind fills with so many images.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
If it must be.  Yes.
That won't be necessary.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
They're...pretending to dress.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
A display of primitive apparatus --
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
Go on now. Do as I say.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
A medical team will be standing by.
Not you?
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Looking to get out.
Who?
Who?
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
Your mother told you that?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
You.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It is.
I'm not jealous!
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
Maybe... maybe...
I?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
Dinner at the White House.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
Please.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Yes, I go now.
What man?
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention her.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
Have you told him what's happening?
You like it?
He's nice.
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
Where'd you get it then?
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
Stealing is a sin.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
You and Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Oh really, when?
What's this about?
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Always.
I've seen him.
I once did a paper on it
Really?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
That's to bad.
Do you have an appointment?
Why not?
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Yeah, come on in.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Swimming trunks.
You bring trunks, Jack?
How will he eat?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Oh.  What do you do?
My brother and I. One each.
Go fuck yourself.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Recognize these two characters?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Lotta water.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
We gotta go, Jack.
What?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Talk.
I'm not unhappy.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
I didn't get her number.
Here, how's this?
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
I'll take my chances.
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Sunday.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Yeah.
Christ, can't you hear it?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
How dare you say you love me.
How long you been at it?
Couple years.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
Yeah.
Be reasonable, Jack.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Sure.
I'm sorry?
Blanche.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Don't take it personally.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
I wear a seven.
Nine.
They're nines.
Did you hear it?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Jack?
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Uh, well ...
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
The name's Baker --
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
And you don't?
I suppose.
In and out.
Nothing.
I'm not upset.
How do you know?
Soap?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Yeah... No.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
No.
Another five years, huh?
How do you know?
Not so good.
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
Sure.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Shut up.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Would it?
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Like you know anything about it.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
You mean like ... condoms?
The Admiral?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
The hospital.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
-- Yes.
Back then -- who wasn't?
You?  Married?
Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
It’s okay, Alan. I get it. I’m in your shoes, I’m thinking exactly the same thing...but here’s the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, it’s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they’re gonna send their kids to college.  It’s just people...
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You’re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
Seven.  Really.
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
That’s right.  Okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I’ll run into the linen store...
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
I think I could figure it out.
Sure.
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
I don’t think so.
It’s your birthday? Today?  What’s your name?  Where were you born?
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
Damn, you are the real thing...
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
What the hell is happening to me?!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Thanks.  To you too...
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
You want me to handle him?  I think I’m ready...
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
Because that’s where I live.
Because you’ll be here.
Pro bono.  You don’t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
HEY!
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
Wait a minute.  You’re my wife?
Okay...
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
It’s wonderful...
For the week?
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
You’ve been Jack Campbell.  And that’s always a good thing...
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
I’m sorry, no...
I'd like that, too.
Maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...
I mean...
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
<u>Should</u>?
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
I'm worried about you.
About me?  How sweet.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
Oh, it is.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
But all these people...
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Showtime.
The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Ben did this.
Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Here's the overall Target Area...
Phase Two.
Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
What're you getting at?
How bad off is he?
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
And take a little trip with them...
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Where can I get a cab back to town?
With no laser --
Now I know...
I always thought it was nothing but red.
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
It's too late now. We must go on.
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
The Breath of God...
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Quite a piece of plumbing.
Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
Sort of.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
Was there any damage?
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Certainly.
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Yeah.
Jezhush.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Personal matters.
We need more -
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
...The heck d'ya mean?
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Chaska.
Yah.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Dad's here.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Okay.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yah.
Yah.
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Oh, yah?
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Nope.
Yah, is this Marge?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah.
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Yah?
Prowler needs a jump.
Yah, ya think?
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
Yah.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
There's no one else here.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
No, I wasn't aware...
Who do you think could've done this?
Sure.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
I want brain parasites.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
This could go on for hours.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Please.
Hear what?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
We did make love?
What?
Marla...
You fucking slut!!
What?
Who do you think I am?
My suitcase was vibrating?
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
What list?
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Is it a problem for you to ask?
What?
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
Shatner.  William Shatner.
No.  Not at all.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Okay.
Promise?
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Fucking sweet.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
... is over.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Yes.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
How'd you know?
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
Should we knock?
He probably already knows we're coming.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
That lucky bastard.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
Yeah, so what happened?
...My Premonition was just like his.
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
That's him, but... he's not here.
Like... 4:25.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
No!
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
You have a responsibility to tell me.
That's right, buddy.
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
No.
That's what I'm here for.
Damn!  Leeches.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Powerful warrior.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Alright.  Home run.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
Forget it.
Why's that?
Where's his father?
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
I could take it or leave it.
Am I out of here?
That's it.  My life.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
Well did you or didn't you?
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
Well, there's nobody special!
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Most men are.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
No, I'm fine... really...
You're all right... you sure...
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
Thanks.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well there....  What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
Hi... Where are my shoes?
Where -- ?
Sshhhh!
A quest?
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Well what am I gonna do with it?
So what? You going to help me?
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Yes. I think that's very fair.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Happily married, probably.
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
You advise us!
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
You're married.
Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
I hope they do.
I'm sorry.
I love it.
No.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Just finish eating.
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
No. How much do I owe you?
No. We have tomatoes.
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
No kidding.
What?
Wait...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
With applesauce?
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Yes, intentionally.
Swimming?
The day after tomorrow.
You don't call that music, though.
What?
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
Is he?
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
It is true.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
Hold onto this.
Steam.
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
I, umm, came to see you.
You look good.
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
No, Baruch.
You gonna talk to him?
Not really.
Hey!
Jus' from around the way.
What?
I wasn't asking.
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
Can I ask anybody now?
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Like when?
For sure?
Fletch...
You don't know me.
Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Thank you.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
Are you serious?
What?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Where are you going?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
What?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Alan Stanwyk.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Take it where?
That's right.
Sure.
Only if you promise not to return me.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Shoot.
Yeah.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
John! You used to fly together!
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
You are a rich woman.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
I ordered lunch.
Can I ask you a question?
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
They're trying to kill me!
I would, actually.
This morning.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
Irwin...
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Jim Swarthout?
Yeah.
But I ain't got you...
I don't know, I never met your father.
Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
Oh... I have some questions.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
So you...
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Contacts.
Hey, they blew me.
Fluck you!
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
What a perv...
Who cares about people?
Why have you come to my planet?
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
What's fine?
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
Shock.
Ciao.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Only on a first name basis.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
Well try, okay?
Did they follow you?
Who's this --
... Salvatore?...
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Fake it.
He got off on six.
Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Why not?
Who's on him?
Policy man in Queens.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
Let yourself in.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
Well, I think you do.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Nothing.
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
Sure.
Wish you weren't.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Wait...
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Uh huh...
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
W...B...2...YXB.
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Why?
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
Are you alright"?
October 22, 1969.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
Wow.
No.
What the hell is that smell?
Whoa, I just...I just...
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Sounds good.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Same thing.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
I vote for me.
Don't do that to me!
Will you come with me?
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
Why?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Hello.  How are you?
Did you stay here last night?
No.  I got here just before you did.
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
I'm sorry.
May be please have the wallet.
Don't say any more.
Damn you, Shelly!
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
I could swear I heard...
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
I've seen it.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
The what?
I'm kind of busy right now...
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
You food'll be right out.
Look --
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Goddamnit!
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
She's yours?
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Randy, c'mon!
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
You don't know shit!
I'm literally going to kill you!
I don't care about being hip anymore.
I guess not.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Right.
And you'll never do it again.
The fire alarm...
Nothing.
I packed it. Just for us.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
You're telling a lie.
This isn't a request.
I...I can't...
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Hi, Sean.
What do you mean???
I'm not!!
Very big.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Shut up, Elliot.
Quietly effective.
But didn't we know it would happen?
What happened eighteen months ago?
And he was there?
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
Does what feel comfortable?
You know about Adele.
She died.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
We're able to surprise each other.
He will absolutely hate it.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
That's completely crazy.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Daddy, wait.
Mystery. Deception.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
It's your best play, Nicky.
She's my gynecologist.
This could be it!
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Since when did that matter?
I can't find it.
I know, Pop.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
It's a simple subject.
Because faith is rewarded.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Sidney.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
Alla puttanesca.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
I don't know.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
He goes to the theater armed.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Eleven.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
"Hell!"
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
There is nothing I can give.
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Somehow I expected not.
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
Have you found him?
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
We don't have the manpower.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Where do we start?
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
Again?
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
It's okay, Eugene.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
I'm sure I could have.
How tall are you?
I've found him too.
Why don't we say we were together?
You'll be next.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
News said two persons killed.
No way. I always do my own work.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Get it over with...
No way. I've got to get out now.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Small town, small bank, big money.
Where did you get them developed?
Whisky and a peach.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I couldn't have... much longer.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
I see it...
I did I killed a man.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
I think so... I don't know.
Sure...
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
No more about Beynon.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
I'll be ready.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
We walk.
No, I'm not.
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
He took the day off.
Can't leave the desk.
Suit yourself.
I kinda doubt it.
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
That right?
Two years.
I know.
And you told Brumby?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
'Good.'
What's it got to do with you?
Yeah.
Well, he drove it into the river.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Confidential, like.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
What?
Is he coming here?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Did my brother Frank find out?
Your brother? What you talking about?
No.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
They said he was drunk.
Thanks.
Large Scotch.
Yeah.
Get knotted.
Is he staying the night?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
What's that supposed to mean?
Do you want breakfast?
Meaning what?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Can't say I do.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
We've got to take you back to London.
But they have to be diplomatic.
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
Where am I going to work?
I had to.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
...this shit...
Eh?
You get a bad month, all of a...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
He's doing very well.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
What?
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
Just the act.
You...
That's what I...
What?
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Somebody...
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Yes.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Yes.
We're not actually talking about it.
Talking about it as a...
You're saying "me."
Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
You...
You.
Yes.
What does that mean?
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He said he filed...
They stole the...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Down the street.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
No, who?
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
I didn't rob...
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
I don't want to go to lunch.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Moss...Who told him?
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
...do you want to go downtown...?
...no...
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Murray...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Murray said...
I will close.
John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.
Alright.
Yeah.  Yeah.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
You're so full of shit.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
You sold eight Mountain View?
Shelly...!
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
What is it?
Kenilw...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Which...
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
The monthly interview...?
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Kenilworth.
Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go. 
Me.
Mm.
What do I...?
Mmmm...
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
Tell me again.
She won't listen.
What...?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
They took 'em...
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
You closed him yesterday.
Yes.
Aren't you going out today?
John...
No, where is it?
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Will you take me?
What position did you occupy?
Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
She couldn't decide.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
Then why do you come to me?
No.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
What's that?
...Who?
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
He's an Italian?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
 And he agreed?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Why didn't someone tell me!
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
Wait... there's something else.
It was a boy.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Mike wants it.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
No strings.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Yes, Michael.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Goodbye, Michael.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Good.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
Just thinking out loud.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Weird.
I wasn't going to try anything.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
You do that.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
Why?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
A homo?
You did not know?
No!
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
Nice place.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Splendid.
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
But why?
It's new.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Why not?
Ah.  A philosopher.
Cut it out!
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Run for what?
Can't you see?  It's raining!
We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
Do I have any other choice?
The Great War?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
What happened?
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
Yes.  Perfectly.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
What rumors might those be?
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
You didn't?
Is there someplace we can talk?
Jesus ...
The business has changed...
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Point-five ...
Yes ... Kip ...
I knew you'd say that, too --
And if he doesn't make it -- ?
One more night --
Let them go --
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Where you been, anyway?
You seem a little hinked-up ...
It's all microchips and shit ...
Hey, Donny --
How you doing, man?
I think so too --
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
What am I supposed to do?
Just hold on... Hold on ...
You all right -- ?
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
What do you got ... ?
You can handle it?
You?
You hear me?
Dad'd be proud --
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
I'm cool.
What?
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
So I was replaced by Mitch?
On account of me.
That what you want?
No. Open her ...
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Cut 'em...
Wrong preposition...
No worries ...
Yeah ... You -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
Of course. Hi, Junie --
Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
So what's in there -- ?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Why don't you leave him alone?
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
Shit.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Let her carry this shit inside.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I can't do it anymore.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
Who's gonna do that?
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Watch what happens.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
She went to Medical school in California.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
How you doin'?
Good.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
Is this a bad time?
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
She's not stupid.
I told you, I just got change.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
I'm Irish.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Retainer...
History.
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
And what do you see?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Yes. Under two conditions.
What're those?
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Okay. How?
--Half-red, half-black--
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Bullshit.
Yeah, cured polio.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Maybe he doesn't care about that.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Now wait a minute--
--Gerry--
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
I don't know. India maybe.
Never been.
What's the point?
Who is he?
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
You're right. I know.
Like what, Will?
Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
How about the ones on that shelf?
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
You think so?
--Well, maybe that means you.
No.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
I don't know.
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Yeah, I think so.
I kind of got that impression.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
No I wasn't...
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
If you bring the caramels.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
No.
Just for fun?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
Come with me to California.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Is that what you think--
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Lots must a died, too.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
I didn't see nothin'.
Goodnight.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Have a little snort?
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
Casy! What you doin' here?
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Lissen, I heard that before--
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Can't you see that sticker?
I stay in my own yard.
What you mean?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck.  Ever'body set now?  Awright, Al, letta go!
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
No--an' look what I got for you.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Pa! Shh!
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
Don't taste bad.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Then what, Tom?
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Morning.
Okay. See you later.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Really?
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Where have I been?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Unbelievable.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Like heroin?
Not the other way around...?
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
I was leaving.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Mmm.
Out Loud?
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
You understand the psychology of the job.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Thank you, no.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Hard to get good help these days.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Not bad. You?
--Nooo--
It's fine.
Tell them my house exploded.
No, I don't have one.
No.
How are you? How's business?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
That's up to Pilgrim.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
You too.
Son?
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Huh?
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
The point was to love each other.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
Whatever you want.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Did he tell you that?
That's not true!
You already did.
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
About what?
Good.
Hi.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Doing what?
Yeah.
You've already made arrangements!?
She will if you think she should.
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
She calls him Tommy...
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
I understand, but Annie, please...
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Mmm. An editor.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I understand...
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Roger.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
What are you doing?
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Revenge.
Thank you!
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
No.
Burn!
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
It's too much machine for you.
Are you challenging me?
Uh, hold on...
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
I'll make it up to you!
Alright, let's boot up.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
My name is the Plague.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
What?
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
We've been better.
She's not dead!
Yes, sir.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Four plus Myers.
Check him out.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
Who you calling?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Coming.
Yeah.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Why?
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
Okay, bye.
Got it Ben.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Least I'm not alone.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
I have a place for that.
Cute.
The guys think I'm too smart.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Bye.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
That's probably all he can do.
Here, Lester.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I don't know.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
I'll be here.
He isn't a man.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Where?
TOTALLY!
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Sure.
See you.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
I saw him...
How?
Will you get her for me?
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
Oh, listen...
Oh--
Oh, yeah.
Great.
Uh --
Mmm.
Oh, is that what it is?
It depends on what way you want to go.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Is this your first job?
Uh-huh.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Hi.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Where are you headed?
Oh, God.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
No?
Oh.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Yeah.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
What are you doing?!
Oh, don't say those words!
Why, you know the situation.
Poor Hannah.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
Was I?
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
I don't know.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Get his wine away.
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
Oh, Frederick!
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
Why?
Oh, yes, you have!
You've been with someone!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Jesus...Jesus!
You know... 
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Y-yeah.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Oh!
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
What are you talking about?
I want to experience childbirth.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Okay, okay.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Oh, he's such a loser!
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Well, how about this?
Singing?
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
So what's new?
Yeah, that's clerical.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
At least I'm open to new concepts!
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Really?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
I'm going to tell you later....
And?
They're offering... 
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
I'm not.
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
...these guy'll back you up.
Impossible.
Seen what, sir..?
Show me the Pigs.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
Awright.
...and then, he'll be coming down.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
...unmarked hundreds....
For a consideration.
'fraid it's too late.
Shut up, Starling...
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
A fellow with five fingers.
I am all attention.
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
...tell them...
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
No, I don't get you...
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...but will that satisfy you?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
The girl needs help.
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
...not to turn around.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
...<u>what</u>...?
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
...what a lovely perfume.
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Then what brings you back?
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
I don't understand.
...yes...?
You want some <u>advice</u>.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope?  Where you going?  I don't want to know.
Your Secret admirer?
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Uh-huh.
Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down.  Either way, you come away with knowledge.
Yeah. And?
I just never thought of you in that...
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Yeah. I guess I do.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Shut the fuck--!
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
King David.
Is she dead?
Oh shit, yeah.
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
Killing her won't solve anything.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
May<u>be</u>.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Shut the fuck up, all right.
I guess.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
playfully shoves his hand away.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
Is it hurting, dear?
What now?
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
I'm not hungry.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
Can I go now?
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
stands and walks toward the door.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Mummy!
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
All right, then.
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Okay so... what's the safest place?
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
No.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Someone special.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
What?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
I only married you for your body.
I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Hey buddy!
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
What do you mean?
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
LaPlante!
The bathroom!  For two days?
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
He gives a good report and I walk?
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Mister LaPlante...
We're all assholes, Bernie?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
Me!
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
What picture?
Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
JOEY!
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Vietnam!
Bodybuilding!
John, I know all about it.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
LaPlante!
Unprofessional.
You're sitting on your ticket.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...
He's pretty... remarkable.
How are they with kids?
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
What toys do you have?
Right.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
Yeah, that was easy.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
Why are you mad at each other?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Honey --
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
Oh -- great.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
It's fun.
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
I have a cold.
The thermometer's broken.
It's a double.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
This ties in with Nash.
It's late.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
Me?  Of course.
Living.  Remember?
What worries you?
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
No -- after you.
Can you really tell from doing that?
I would like to say goodbye.
You'll no see me again.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
To talk to you.
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Jennifer.
I know.
I've lived all over the world.
Why don't you tell me.
Must you fight him?
Why?
It has to be.
I was working on the cataloging.
I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
This cannot be.
That's what the Kurgan said.
I know.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
It's not for me to decide.
My dreams died long ago.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
No.  The money, please.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
It's about Mars --
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
My father.
Dennis.
I overheard him with the girl.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
You have his address?
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Yeah.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
I can't go without Thomas.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Keep your head down.
Where are they?
Get a phone number for the Smiths.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
Can you get into the office?
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
Smith will know.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
A delegation.
Of course.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
How many in your family?
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
You said you had no whiskey.
Whiskey?
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You will tell them the truth.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
You have no whiskey?
We’re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
What is it?
You’re drunk.
For supplies, you drive.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
What?
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
I will give you my house.
I couldn't help.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Dawn. Then they go.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
How can we help him.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
No, no.
Yes.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Many times.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
How dead?
Many beers.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Who is this Simon?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
-- what was he doing here?
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Don't push it.
Why?
I don't think so...
There's always exceptions.
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
It'll have to do.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
You didn't think to ask?
I was in the middle of --
And here's your goddamn severance!
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
Something with the power, I don't know!!
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
The lockdown thing.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
Over here.
For the love of God....please...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
You say you saw some activity here?
Why don't you pass me your plate?
Ok...
Go to your room!  Now!
I'm ok mommy.
He's blessing the house.
Daddy, please!!!
Daddy help!
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
To our family.
So what are you saying?
I don't know what I'm saying.
Who?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Aubrey!
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Maura.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Oh, that's nice...
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
What!
Thank you.
It will not take long...
I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
That is the story of my life.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
And he still sits there?
Sure.  Why?
I'm sorry.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Yes.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Yes. 53
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
"You could be swinging on a star."
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Why try?
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
Yeah.  The big E.
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Wha--
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Too bad.
God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
Tell me about it...
The Jerky Circle!
He didn't look unhappy!
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
Muncie!
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
I'm sure I --
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
...You do?
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
What a beautiful thought.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Oh Norville, I --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
This you're familia' with.
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
Yeah, but, buddy --
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
Not even behind your back?
Oh my God, sir!
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Fah from it...
Maybe he's wise.
...Her mother needs an operation...
...adenoids.
Thank you for waking me.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
You mean a figurehead.
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
It'll wait.
But she's not dead, Wes.
Of course not!
Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
And charming?
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
You want that?
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
In other words, I'm on trial.
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Elena.
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
That shirt?
What?
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Well?
We'll talk in the morning.
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Anyone special? You know...
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
That's besides the point.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Well, we can talk about it.
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Of course.
With Mikey?
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Yes.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
You ask what the point is?
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
All will be revealed, baby.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
The Idiot?
Truly? Do speak.
I dunno. I --
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
With who?
Good.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
I had him!
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
But there wasn't any...
Okay.
Then change it.
How much closer would you say you were?
I don't remember.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
No.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
You know my plan of action.
That's right.
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
You know I remember that.
What are we thinking?
Habit.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
What did he look like?
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
The other guy?
You're not missing much.
Best friend?
That's a long time.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Who?
What was it?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
But you wanted to.
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
We had feared we were the only ones...
But how did you come into existence?
Are you the leader of tis group?
Knew? You mean he is...
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I can't save her.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
Is this my birthday?
But you're the fairest by far.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Not you my dear.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
Sit still. It's not finished -
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Yes...
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
But if she dies...
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Yes...
I want a woman.
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
NO!!!
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
That's all past, Lestat.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
You can't look at them...
What about coffins?
Can a vampire feel love?
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
It's over, I'm telling you...
Yes!
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Don't even think about it.
No.
Yes.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Yeah.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Why are you being like this?
Can't what?
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
I'll talk real slow.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Yes!
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Good winds and bad winds!
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
Thea is an orphan.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
How do you know what my father thought - -
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
Yes?
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt —— after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Go through with what?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
They went out of business years ago.
Thanks.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Of course it's the place.
Yes, sir.
Mother . . .
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Uh-huh.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmm?
Oh . . .
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Okay.  What's yours?
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
Well, no younger than I was.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
You may kiss my hand.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Going up to see Zuzu.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
What?
Oh, shucks . . .
Is she responsible for the punch?
Yee-hah!
We better go back in.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
I need a hand here....
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
Right.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Oh, c'mon.
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
What else you got?
My ass!
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
That's it.
Why?
Because they're playing our song.
Good.
In the den.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Terrific.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
We have to do something.
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
That's you.
Me neither.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
Shut up.
Nope.
Anything.  Anything.
Figure they split?
Power line.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
You do everything your parents tell you?
No.
When are we going out?  You and me?
Michael....
He thought he had a good reason.
So?  So?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
You buying?
Want another one?
See you later.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Up.
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
... Mean through the tubes?
Well, that's why you got it.
So?
Thirty feet???
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Nobody told me.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
I know.
Don't blame yourself.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Now what's this do?
Hold still, damn it!
I am serious.
Can't help it... ahh...
What the hell's there?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Got a job for me?
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
We need milk....
I have work....
Where's my mother?
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
You make sure they come?
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
You check it....
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
Mom, please don't start that again....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
No one does till they learn....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
I have my own little island.
But it gets cold in winter....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
Will you leave me alone...?
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
They put bombs on dolphins....
The shark will get it for us.
Lots of times....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
Shit....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I don't like it....
Shove it....
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
You heard. Look for the knife.
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
So am I. But where's my money?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
No .. You didn't know that ..
How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
I don't see that at all ..
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
That's bullshit,
No.
I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
Me?
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Why?
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
The man from the F.B.I.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Don't mix very well with beer.
I think I've found a hand.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Could you just stop moving?
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...
No no. I knew.
You think so?
No no, I know --
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
Well, I'm happy for you.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
-- especially one like this.
Plus, you could use that commission.
You don't have to explain.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
I don't know --
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Yes.
Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Why not?
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Why not --
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Don't be silly.
Pleasure.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
Let's go the zoo.
You said "fuck".
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
What?
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
You hate to swim.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Nothing.
He's this way.
What about Eric?
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
What?  Why?
How close do you have to be?
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
The velociraptors.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Our chance to do what?
Where's Kelly?
She's with Sarah!
It'll hold!
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
Birdshit?
I believe in him.
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
I'm trying!
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
And scary.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
He sends his apologies.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Really?
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
You want to talk about this?
I didn't say I was scared.
We gotta do something.
What?  What can we do?
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
Wu?
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
He left us!  He left us!
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Help me with this.
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Video store?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
So?
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
How do we prove it?
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Cute waitresses?
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
You're not going to be there?
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Up there.
Yes -- that's us.
-- Small.
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
In a manner of speaking.
Another one?
What an extraordinary request!
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Well, I --
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
One of you must be mistaken.
Yes.
No.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
I wouldn't put it past him.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I've heard of it happening.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
... Just a perception.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
-- Just doing our job.
The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
Orlac is an account?
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
And we're upset too.
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
It's ... lovely.
I can't imagine you crying.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
They' re dead.
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Yeah.
Compassion.
Uh uh.
Mm.
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Guess!
Didn't want you.
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Here please.
All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
Oh no, I don't think --
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
Well --
Arlyn Page.
But if it's someone else I do.
My bed.
I was wondering what that was.
I called Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
That who?
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Goodbye, Pete.
Two years ago? Sorry.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Town Police.
We grew up together. Kids.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I don't believe Tom's alive.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Yes sir, we know he --
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
Detroit.
Welcome to the... 
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
I guess...
I'm allergic to onions.
No.
You mean for good?
Dad?
I love you...
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
What did you do when you were little?
Was there Burger King?
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Sustained.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Then I have concluded my questions.
Six years.
No, I did not.
Objection!
Objection!
And did you have a close personal relationship?
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
A heavy drinker?
Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, do you love him?
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
Sure.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Things? What kind of things?
Joanna said that?
No.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Sure.
Any day.
Ha!  You tell me.
A moment.
Yes. I am ready.
It is alright, Father.
Are you? Of whom?
No!
I have a copy for you.
We did not.
We do not know.
Ask whatever you will.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Is that a true story, or pretend?
As you say.
I would not know. Maybe.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
You have grown up very good.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Too young?
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Thank you.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
I need to see his habitat.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
Yup.
Bastard bit my chopper.
You do?
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Oh, bullshit.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
I <u>told</u> you.
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Just forget it.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
I'm not mushing it.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You calm down!
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
He's floating.  Take it home.
Hector.
I'll call the coroner.
Are they feeding?
It's just that--
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
Look ten feet into the water.
I guess.
Absolutely.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Wild guess.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<u>You</u>?
Liar?
Why not?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Starling -
Thanks.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
I think so.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Sometimes you do.
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
Then please - do this test for me.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
A cattle ranch?
How long did you live there?
Two months.
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
And - one morning I just - ran away...
But you could. You did.
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Can we rest soon?
Why did they turn back?
Miss.  May I?
There was none!
I sent three men to Webb!
I am sorry, Duncan...
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Your enemy...
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Yes.
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
And?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Fuck your orders!
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
What?
Still...you did the right thing.
How much time does that give us?
I can't see them!
Where's Doc?!
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
What's your air reading?
And it killed Bo?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Itches like hell.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
No fuckin' lie...
Let's hope it holds.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Right.
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Probably no longer than four weeks.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Well what?
I am not fucking interested.
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Son, have a look in his locker.
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
What the fuck is going on?
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
Out the back.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
What do you mean, me?
. . . What?
Tom?
I want your bar.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
What about all the gear?
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
What do you mean?
Oh, come on, Amado--
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Chaos.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
You're testing me?
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Nice job.
Charley Wade.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Colt Peacemaker.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
Come on in.
My mother said he never asked about--
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
So you're going into the Army?
Good.
Cool.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
You going to get married?
It's a .45.
Seriously.
That ring--
Take that pair over in the corner--
Right.
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
No.
You thought any more about our murder?
Hey, Sam.
And the ten thousand?
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Sam--
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
The Sheriff.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
No. Is he sick?
He ever accept cash for a favor?
What?
What do you think?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Well, you were working there--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
I'll see what's going on.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
Amado.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Yeah?
What was your father's name?
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
I been working on a few things.
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
You know who it was?
Runnin' numbers illegal.
Been away. Up to Houston.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Who?
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
I love weird.
Nope.
doorway) And who's that?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
That's so cool.
Why would I do that?
What do you mean, "all of us?"
Yes...
Yes.
Where do I sign?
Harry.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
I don't know where you'd start.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
Out!  Out!
Good.  There.  Yes?
What makes you so sure?
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
I'd like to hear them.
Mr. D'Amour?
Are you sure?
Are you a believer, then?
A ticket home,
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
What?
That.
At birth.  I don't know you --
How the fuck do you do that?
He deserved it.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
Will that do?  No?
Nobody's better off this wav!
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
You didn't try hard enough.
Call me tomorrow.
Binding you.
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Why would I want to?
How long have you been married?
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
What did you study?
Oh, what do you do with that?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
I know, it's stupid.
No.
It's Charlotte.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Because that would be too easy.
Yes, no.
Ok, bye.
Oh?
Yes?
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Uh, no.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
That's ok.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
I don't know.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Sure.
Ok, bye.
Promoting that action movie I did...
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Sushi.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
When did they find her?
This is the person...you were talking about?
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Yes.  It's exactly...
What time did you make it for?
And how would you describe him?
But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
You ready?
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Miette, come here and relax.
Kelson, hold on a second...
How many weeks are you honey/
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
I'll bet.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
Please, the children.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
Trick him.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
I'm going to look around.
What?
Comfort.
That's true.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
Sure.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
I know who he is.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Nothing.  So good luck.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
There you go.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I don't remember that.
What'd you do?
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
You're cold?
Then I'll get you some punch.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
I don't wanna see that.
Too many times.
But?
Thanks.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
I wouldn't know.
Your Dad play?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
You do act different.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Kay.
Shut up!
Who's Spalding?
I know, right?
You do see me standing here, right?
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
Plan to.
Right here.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Not really.
We're going to get some food.
Are you out of your mind?
Least she had time for me.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
Yup.
What are the doctors saying?
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Getting there.
You're serious.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Something was just missing.
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Quincy, please...
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Okay...
Why?
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
No.
Yeah.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
No.  No.
I don't wanna talk to you.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
No one else in there with you?
Yeah, but I don't know --
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
That's great, thank you.
Yeah.
Okey-doke.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
You wanna make a deal with me?
...yeah...
Let's make a deal.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
please, what is it, please --
Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT, DAD WE NEED TO GET HIS MONEY AND GO.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
That's right.
Picky, picky.
Mmm.Hmm.
You see?
You don't need braces.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
You do?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
It's ok.
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
Graduation?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Alright.  Thank you.
Yep.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Are you asking me that?
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, "If I'd known I wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
Psychology major?
In five years?
It's not your given name, right?
They wouldn't?
...are you Phil...?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
yeah.
Are you lyin' to me?
I don't know a loud crash.
I went out last night.
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
You on any medication?
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
Slowly or quickly?
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
Bye.
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
Paula.  Ellen.
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
But you can't say....
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
I don't know what I've done.
I'm Bob.
Are you on drugs right now?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Linda --
818-753-0088.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Water.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
yeah.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Stand up.
Why did you do this?
Go to bed.
Go to bed.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
And you were not hurt?
That is good.
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
I am preparing for a ball!
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Soon enough.  Here we are.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
Three days??!!
But -- what is he doing?
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
What use am I?
He is right, d'Artagnan.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Athos, my friend!
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Get out of my way.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
Your Majesty has had many women --
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
Forgive?!
I must insist, Sire.
What was the end page?
Yes, yes, go on.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Alright, stay on the phone.
Fine...
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
You're the mysterious type, right?
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
Please...
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
OK...where do you want to start?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I knew I could count on you.
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
Screw him!
Did you have sex with her?
Nahhh...
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
Could he handle a direct contact?
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
How much do you know?
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Why not?
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
You look all right now.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
Why?
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
That's narrow?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
See if there's another label underneath.
This is our boy...!
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
In the kitchen.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.
Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
Uh... sure...
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
What's average?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
You haven't smoked in two years.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
How?
And Hobbs died?
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
Yes, I thought so.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Yes.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
What's up?
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Yeah...
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
If you want...
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
You're a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
Each show is worse than the next.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
They're asking for it.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
Are you sure?
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Bob Gorsky.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
Oh, God.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
No, it's all right.
Just get me outta here.
Go.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Right now?
How do you know all this?
I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
And she knows what?  Everything?
What did she tell you?
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Do it!
You're the Oracle?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Most guys do.
Of what?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
We can't leave him!
We have to!
What?
I'm coming with you.
It's a city?
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
How?
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
What do they want?
What are you talking about?
Cypher, I thought --
Follow me.
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Ok.  Wait here.
So?
No.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
And say what?
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
Wouldn't bother me.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
No.
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
You said it.
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
I know.
Chinese food?
Yes, you did.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
What did he do?
Nothing.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
No.
Ok.
That's the word...preoccupied.
Watch your language.
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
Come on.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
You mean it's heisted.
Friends of yours Michael.
Quiet please.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
It's for the party, Dad --
That you've been to Susan?
But what?
And that?
Hi.
Hello, Quince.
He'll wait --
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
In my sleep.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
You have a way with words.
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
How nice for you both.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
Joe, you do get around.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Well, that's very interesting.
'It's up to Joe'?
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
You loved back?
She knows how she feel.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Oh yes, I do.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
No.
I'm sorry.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Be sorry for nothing.
Excuse me?
No.
It was everything.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
It gets worse.
We know all that we need to know --
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
'Threw' you?  Where?
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Not at all.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
What do you mean?
There's one to every rule.
What's it like where I'm going?
So can I.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
Are you sad, Bill?
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
You were just curious?
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
'Fish'?
And I don't give a shit.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
No.
What you were talking about.
Quiet.
Next week?
Sure.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Don't get dirty, Dad --
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
We've met.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
Daddy --
Nothing lasts.
Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
No, let's go.
Hi, Leonard.
Interested in buying one?
Yeah, I remember you.
Take the money and walk away!
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Sorry.
Yeah, I hated it.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Who?
What's this all about?
Don't protect him.
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
My name's Leonard.							 *
So why did you come here?
You've read it a hundred times.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
You're living.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
We're not certain!
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
Deal.
It goes very fast.
Later!  Do you dance?
Cost less.  That's the point.
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
And what do I do with him?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
As in...?
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
What are you talking about?
How will it stand up?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Alonzo...!
White supremacist types.
You sure?
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
"Future" of...?
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Yeah?
Yeah, oh yeah.
I show you what problem --
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
You like it? Take a look.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Twenty bucks...
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
I'm going to Florida.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Uh, yessir.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
You got it.
Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
History, man, history. How much?
We go through the wall?
Don't make me laugh.
Shit.
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
Yes...?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
What did he do?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
That's a great philosophy.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Who got the Frenchman out?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Take a look.
H-how do I get...?
Right.
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Hurry, the woman needs help!
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
I was just late.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
The scent won't last...
Your arm, you can't...
Ah...
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
I DIDN'T...
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
You want me to burn my book?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
I'm glad you like it.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
I'm almost done.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Maybe you can, Libby.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
Buster.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
Did they win?
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
Magic...
What was the top bid?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
No.  Should I?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Far right.
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
Listen to what?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
They've got a book for this?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Can you think of a better one?
Much.
You don't trust me.
Yes?
No.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
Excuse me?
And then what?
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Roger that.
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
But why tell us?
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
Yes.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
I always have, Claire..
Theyíre dead.
Whoís dead?
Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
No sir.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
That depends.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Like Job?
Let's move!
Time up.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
I didn't touch it.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Then what am I doing here?
I thought I'd take some now.
I guess.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Itís not working.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
I don't know what you mean.
You haven't said anything.
He got hit by a bus.
In a month.
It's temporary.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I brought you something.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
Yesterday.
Seven years ago.
No!
Me neither.
What did I do?
You ruined my life.
Oh no I didn't!
I can't do that!
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Come on.
This is where we're going!
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
I'm really afraid.
No.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Yeah, I'll be in.
Bobo, take the cart away.
I don't understand.
How about a month from today?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Pop.
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
No. He don't.
What! How do you know?
A wife knows.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Oh.
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
He should pay.
I don't know.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
No idea.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Do you have a girlfriend?
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
Yes.
Don't shit where you eat.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
It's a house.
He's a plumber.
Oh.
You see that moon last night?
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
Well, who is your lord?
Now - go!
Oh, please!
No, it isn't.
You're a liar.
Come on then.
Ni!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
Quite.
There.
I warned you!
Who did we lose?
Man!
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
Come on, patsy.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Good idea, O Lord!
You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
What is your name?
I don't know that!
They cost fifty pounds each!
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
I can understand that.
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
But, Mother ...
Father, lad.
I was saved at the last minute.
Leaving the room ... yes.
No ... just keep him in here.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
I don't think I was.
We must examine you.
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Seventy a year.
How about yourself?
It's only grief makes her like she is.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
You watch your tongue.
You know nothing about her!
Get out.  Out!
Be careful who sees it.
What do you take me for?
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
Yeah.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
Do you know who you address, sir?
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
How will I know?
I need a man who knows where I am.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
There are important papers from --
Don't think I can't persuade her.
You're injured.
Why do you think I keep her here?
The greasy pole.
No love.
What does he know about the Highlands?
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
I beg your pardon?
Yes.
I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
Not too protracted, I hope.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Just them?
Why?
I understand he was in a fight.
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
And now I am back.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
He?
I came from the city on the left.
Yeah...
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
I'm coming over.
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
She thought Benz was at school.
It's already out.
What?
Yes I am...
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
And then keep on driving?
Yes...
You have no time.  What is your question?
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
There is no problem.
Sure.
Okay.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
So, what did they say?
Well, I ...
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Right. See ya.
May I have your name please?
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
Unh, unh.
We'll take our check.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Wally Brown.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Thank you... thank you very much.
Yeah, what for?
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Sure.
What's going on ?
We have to climb up that.
Give me a fucking.....
I'm working on it.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
A dragon.
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Don't have to tell me twice.
Yes, sir Mom. 
Not yet.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
I am thirty two.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
He's been expecting you.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
Aren't you the bitter one.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
I just need to sit and think for a second.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Are you writing a poem?
Oh, just put it over there.
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
This is California, anything is possible.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Of course.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Can I see him?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
Special effects?
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
Then I have come to the right place.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
You're so clever.
Vada.
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Nick?
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?

For the mini-bike fund.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
This is it I guess.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
He was caressing.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
You know how I feel about you.
Is that a yes?
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Oh no.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
You leave your father to me.
All right, here.
Yeah, all right...
No.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Oh, how do you mean?
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Pointing upwards Look...
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Hand me the canula.
I love this guy! 
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
No sweetheart, you can't.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
This is one big house for one single person.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Come on sweetie.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
No, I'm divorced.
No.
The boys at school don't think I am.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Aarrggh.
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
I can't, I have to go home.
Oh no!  UUH.
You have no personality.
Never mind.
It's my mother.
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
Sure.
Bye Ma.
Uh huh.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Something like that.
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
Sure.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Only.  If he wants to.
He won't get mad, huh?
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
Don't you see...
... that this is all my fault?
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
I can't wait for you to meet her!
Waiter! Check, please!
What, leaving school...
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
... maybe it's congratulations.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
Shhh.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
This is where I proposed.
To him.
... and you knew about this.
What is that sup...
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Hi! Star.
No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
What's wrong with her.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
She's fine.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
They can come to the concert in the park.
I said 'no!'
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
Let me know when you do, all right?
What is a turkey shoot.
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Replacement party.
Who's that?
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Fungus?
When I was little, in church.
Do you ever do any writing?
He's a member of our congregation.
Linnea?
Wow!
Oh.
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Oh.
Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. Ain't never been married. Won't either.
Yea.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Oh?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
How long have you been together?
Come on.
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
You bet.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
May I see your costume?
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
That's what Tim said.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
I can appreciate that.
Anything.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yes, sir.
Yours.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Was what worth it?
I'm sure we will.
When have they ever been right?
So, what now?
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Jesus...
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
Ya know, I was.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
What are we talking about?
Out.
It sure is.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
What d'you think?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Where's he at?
Just so you do your work.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
I don't know.
And his age?
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Went to college, huh?
In Birmingham.
Maybe.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
You got a problem all right.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
'Been up north?
No.
That's the way he is.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
Your boy.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
No. But a small one.
My kids want me to teach them.
We'll be all right.
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Watch out!
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
When I get set, I'll send for you.
I bet she's easy jam.
'Bye, Jocko.
Who're you?
I heard you.
Better get him to a hospital.
Okay.
Sorry.
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
No thanks, Lee.
No, they won't.
Guess it's never been easy.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I guess not.
Oh yeah?
I'll be seeing you.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
You hate Raoul?
Don't play with me.
Of course...
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
You son of a bitch...
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
What about McCoy?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
What are you talking about?
I don't have a girl.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Jah guides us.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
What are you talkin' about?
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
You haven't got it?
Case.
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
Why would you want me to kill you?
What about before that?
A regular Fagan.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Dixie McCoy didn't.
They'll cut you down.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Hold on.
What?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Yeah, I know.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Jos, that's not what we're --
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Anita!

No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Kristen got a quote?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
You said that already.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
It was a long time ago -
I can't do this.
Sorry. Forgetful.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
So what are you thinking for college?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Yeah, I have.
That's what I'm saying.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Well, a ball player.
Lock.
And heavy...
I know.
Just what?
Good.  I'm hungry.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
Who told you to choke up that way?
Shut up, Grady.
What are you doing here?
How come?
That's okay, I wanted to.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
Making friends?
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
Can't be good news coming from you.
What?
A little basic, but nice.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
For what?
Who would know where they were hidden?
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
I beg your pardon?
Freddy.
Cooling down.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Coffee?
Really, no.
No.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Bye.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Absolutely fine about it.
Why?
I don't know either.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Oh no no -- no.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Well done you.
Eleven.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
You have a stunt bottom?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
You and every person in this country.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
But... wait... there are things to say.
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
Who is it?
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
And this is William.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Do you want to stay?
Yes -- sort of...
Working with Leonardo.
Di Caprio.
Yes.  What do you think?
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Have you got a moment?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Who?  Someone famous?
That's right -- Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Can I help you?
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
I think you do, yes.
Buggered?
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
And you get on very well.
Just take my work for it.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Oh sure.  Of course.
Fabulous.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
Would you like to start?
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
So do I!
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Yes, ma'am?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
So long, kid.
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
They went that way.
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Shhh...
Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
I said out!
No!
I just started!
No!
Hit me.
A nickel.
He's not!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Poker!
You bet, Doc!
Good. Good.
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
All right!
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
Hi.
Big man!
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Bet!
You're a witness, Doc!
No way...
That!
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your grandmother?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Yes.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
Exactly.
No.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
But Faith--
Smoking or non-smoking?
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Yes.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
Hi.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Sure is.
Just since yesterday.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
So?...
No.  He's never asked me.
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
What about your job?
What'd you find?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Oh my God.  Where?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Men have ways.
What about Peter?...
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
I'll be back before you leave.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
My God... you're right.
Yes.  He is.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Oh.
Huh?
You miss me?...
And we didn't have to bring another present?
You said it differently then.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
That's really romantic.
I'm gonna take her home first.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
He probably gave 'em an argument.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Thicker than water.
Maybe.
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Don't say that!
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
I'm with Terry.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
Want to go out and have one with me?
How about another one?
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
For— not being any help?
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
You?
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Get out of my way.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Pop!
I don't want to hear it in there.
About Edie?
Good luck.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Our identification.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Gimme.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
Aw, Johnny... .
Listen, Johnny—
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
One of these days.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
What do you mean?
Be careful!--They'll see you.
What can we do?
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
...And I thought you loved me.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
Her dance has pleased me.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
When!?
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Yes, Master.
Then why do you shake so?
Yes, sir, Master.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Aannnnaahhnn.
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
And the one driving the other car?
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
I know a Glenn.
His assistant.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Just that she got away.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Love is funny.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
You might not have a choice.
And who watches your back?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
You have to know what you're talking about.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Yeah, why?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I don't smoke.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Glenn didn't tell you?
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
I thought everything.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
Sure.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Yeah...
Yes.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Those guys bother you?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
It smelled.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Or once.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
It would be worth the risk.
Why not?
I don't know.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You think he's lying?
The backseat.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
I know what you're talking about.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
The flight?
And is Foley a part of this?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Right now, son.
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Something better.  Open it.
No thanks.
You used to like it.
Huh.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
None I'd like to share.
My little girl, the tough babe.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
I didn't mean it.
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
I'm out of fuel!
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
You were more like brothers.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Don't get smart with me, son.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
I can't. It's all too much.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Yeah. Like that.
Good.
Charlie, let's make love.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Right here. Now sit down.
What?
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
I'll never give up.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I'd love to.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
All right. But this better be good.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
Please don't shout.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
What does Charlie think about that?
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Sort of.
What's that?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
So are you. You've got a vision.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
It sucked.
I'm not hungry.
He was dead. You know he was.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
I miss him too...
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
A reaction to AZT...
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
I'm not going to die.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
Of course.
Funny.
Kids are great.

I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.

Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
What?
Rayisha.
Rayisha. Very nice.
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
Let's find you a drink.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
We proceed, representing your estate.
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
I still am.
What do you love about it?
A good start.
Gay movies.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Really?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Get real.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
You're in trouble.
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
That's perfectly clear.
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
My lettuce is wilting.
Any women on board?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
You had one guy "like that?"
Beckett?
Jesus.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
<u>Listen</u>.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
I never said I was.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Just shut up, okay?
What, you're goin' off, too?
We're all on the same hajj now.
For now.
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
You <u>don't</u> see.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
About the girl.
Not if I'm the one.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
The best. But we won't need them.
Shut up.
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
No.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
Him.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
What signal?
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Come on. Get me out of here.
Yes, I can do that.
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
My name is Taylor.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Read it yourself.
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Of course.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
No!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Then the worm has definately turned for you man.
No... I move faster alone. 
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Later...
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Thank you.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
How long would that take?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
And do you amuse the guests?
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
No thanks.
You didn't have to tell him that.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
They know you here--know your name.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Couldn't be.
Absolutely sure.
Us?
All right--following me.
Nothing matters.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Do you have to leave the note?
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Who told you I was married?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
If I understand what you meant by that.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
Sometimes.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
All right. Get him.
This way.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
And without much discrimination.
I've got good ears.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I wouldn't know.
Would that make me a heel?
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Send that?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
I've met her.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
I think so.
Should be over there.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Now, you're being beastly.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
I'll take your word.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
Aye.  You have a point there.
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
Two.
Not too far, I hope.
You ought to know why.
What does it look like?
You already have the checks, darling.
Of course.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
And some of that.  Sorry.
Good.
Are you going to have coffee?
I thought it was tremendous.
How nice.
I have to be up early. 
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Well, you should.
Might?
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Ha ha...
Far too long.
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
All right.
Yes, you said.
Now listen...
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Oh no!
Promise?
No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
No.
What's their program?
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
My man!
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
I say when it's over!
The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
Babes.
What?
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
The shit they pull, huh?
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
The fucking punks are surfers.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
I saw it.
There's something else, Major...
Where the hell is his body?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Twenty-five percent.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
No.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
No.
Stolen?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
I never joke about money.
You couldn't afford it.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Do you plan everything?
And why do you say that?
Occupational hazard?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
No?  Why's that?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Come with me?
What id we run into someone I know?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Fuck off.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
I really am sorry.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
Business.
It was good.
It felt good.
And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Doing what?
Vivian's in sales.
Goodbye, Bill.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
What if they serve soup?
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Yeah.  Thanks.
I just might do that.

You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
But you don't know where he is.
The body?
Open it up.
Has it got any sports in it?
Yeah. It's really good.
Because I can stop now if you want.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.

That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
I must know.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --

What?
Your grandfather's here.
"Honeymoon,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Mr. Bialystock ...
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
What scheme?
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Aaaaaaaaaa!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Who wrote it?
Okay, take it off, take it off.
Only if we ask him.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
Really, I never dreamed ...
But he has long hair!
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Heil you know who!
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Vat?
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Send for Goebbels.
I told them we invaded England.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
Oh.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
And when she left, she never came back.
I live there. Alone.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
What difference does that...
May I talk to you?
Is Mary here?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
A good reason, I suppose.
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
I ought to call the police right now!
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
She'll need both of us.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Watch your tenses.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
What makes you sound so certain?
Hospital clean.
Why not?
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I'd like to.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
You'd know, of course.
Why do you ask that?
She sounded strong...
Why don't you go away?
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Norman took a wife?
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Satisfied with your cabin?
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
And now that your mother's dead?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
From what?
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Maybe you want my money, too.
But where do the rats come in?
You found Buckley?
Well, news of Buckley?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Come on, we're wasting time.
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
A voice ...
There's no child here.
No!  Good night!
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
You lie!
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'd love to.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
Are you giving me this straight?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Let it go.
How's every little thing?
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Horsefeathers!
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Is that a fact?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Day or night?
I could go out of town.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Well, all right.
You were pretty bad, huh?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Well, nothin'.
Yeah.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Well, it's not very plain.
But how would you find him?
Daddy, what's the matter?
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Yeah.
Okay.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Then why does she act so dumb?
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
Go on, Doctor.
I think we both know her.
What do you think of her, honey?
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Boys? You say to me boys?
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Galley what?
Oh, yeah?
I see. Outside it.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Yes, Ma'am.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Be quiet, Rose.
It'll get better now.
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I was going to tell him.
You're not gonna see him again.
Incestuous.
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Clench your teeth.
They shot us all, kid.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
Then, why'd we tie him up?
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Well, sir...
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
No you're not.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Maybe it's enough.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Yeah, sure.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Leia!
Ahhh...
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Let's see.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
We shall double our efforts.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
I know, father.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
There is no conflict.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
How many languages do you speak?
Oh well.  How about you.  
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I told you, my car broke down.
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Yes.
Dammit, Janet.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
Weiss.
I hope so my darling.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
You know this earth - this person.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Want to come again and stay
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
The delivery boy.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
Shell-shocked!
I think it's closed.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
I don't think I belong here.
Could ya take off that hat.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
Yeah...
...What?
...What?
Paulie, please --
I can't go out.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
You didn't!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Owe you what?
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
No, man, it's very smart.
Where're you off to now?
Does that bum have to say that?
Don't like yours neither.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
That's it? -- Completely?
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
How'd you know?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
Stuff it, man!
...Yeah.
I won't.
...What?
...What?
More like thirty.
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
...Did ya fight last night?
Ya puttin' me on?
Ya got a good mind for dates.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Whatta you get outta this?
Real good.
Would you keep goin'?
Great, kid, great.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
What?
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Whatta you think?
The story -- what's happenin'?
I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
What can I do about it?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Oh, no...
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
What the hell's a freeway?
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Does it hurt?
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
He's right here in the...
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Aren't you the lucky one...
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
Get away from there.
No, it's not.
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Uh? Uh?
Leave Me!
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
The what?
Good-morrow, cousin.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Romeo, come forth.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
I have.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
You kiss by the book.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
I take thee at thy word.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Well what shall I swear by?
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Pink for flower.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Do you really think so?
Well I don't!
And I don't believe you...
How do we know that?
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
I'd stake my reputation.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
You first, Edvard.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
What do you mean?
Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
Now that is an interesting proposition.
Sent it where?
What's that?
I do, I do...
And you respect him.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
You seem one to me.
Did he bring that with him?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Like Larry or Swede.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
Yes I do.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
Something like that.
Closest and oldest.
I'll work on it...
You sure?
Gonna be tough.
Why didn't you kill him?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
I get the picture.
I want to get some hounds down here.
Don't lie to me!!!!
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
Because...I know.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Torch it?!
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
I can't do that.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
You killed him...
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
It's NOT too late!
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
Two thousand...
No.  It's not.
No.  But he would, probably.
You deserve it is the occasion.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
That son of a bitch.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Great...
Yeah, it is...
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Hi.
C?
No I don't.  You sure you haven’t seen her?
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Sort of.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Dwayne -
Calm down --
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
Not Yu.  You!
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
How do you know?
It's a long story.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
No.  It was my singing.
What did you say?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
What is it?
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
Why did you help me?
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
It's okay, I got lots more.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
I'm fine.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
You don't know what a shortcut is?
Did you make the plate?!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Stool pigeon.
Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
What's wrong with that?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Or somethin'.
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
God bless you, Maggie.
Of course.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
"Nothing but net."
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Where do you think she's going?
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Then come for dinner.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Tootaloo.
Looking for Maggie.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
He is not!
You can turn that finger around.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
No.  You take it.
Missed me bad, huh?
I already explained about that.
What!?
I'd rather not.
Me?
I'm okay with that.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
Is there somebody else?
Nope.
It sounds nice.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
They're going to love you.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
I love you.
Even when you were young?
Go to the Symphony --
That doesn't make any sense.
-- it was a betrayal.
Whatever it is.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I know.
Turn on your radio!
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
What?
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Who is this?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
Why not?
She died.
Yeah.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
What's tira misu?
But how am I going to get there?
What is it?
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
Right.
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Sure.  Looking good.
Jed's got cables.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Oh, right.
Jonah!
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
I just called for a second.
Are you going with her?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
How's it going?
Whose side are you on anyway?
Yeah.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Antonio paid for it.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Can be what?
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
You weren't waiting for me.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Will you be still?
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
But honey ...
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
The what!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
No, Why?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Now that's down-right insulting.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Colette ...
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
I can't leave.
Never heard of him.
And you admire that?
What do you want from me, Colette?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
This has nothing to do with him.
What is wrong with you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
I know a guy.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
No. I'm good.
Was he the president?
Yes, Jimmy
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
What does that mean?
Hey, I don't play that.
What?!
Okay! Okay!
When?
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Turns out he's connected.
They have. But they never found a lab.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
And you've got wiener breath.
What do you mean?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Maybe he isn't showing.
Casualties?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Sir?
Spit it out, Captain.
As a matter of fact, I am.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
Say what, Cap'n?
White-walls?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
Pass.
Did he see any sign of them?
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
What about the company?
Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
PUSH!
Maybe.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Yup, hell of a mission.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
You're welcome, John.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Ours is not to reason why.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
But we accomplish the mission.
No, sir.
That's a mystery to me.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Yeah?
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Frogs?
Yeah?  So?
What are we likely to run into?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
What's the profile?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
No, no he's not.
This evening is over.
That's right.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
What's a scam?
Hang in there, man.
Yes.
I admit nothing.
I am.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I'm sorry.
I love you too honey.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Okay, I give up.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Bon voyage.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
What am I supposed to think?
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Are you busy on Friday?
So you're monumentally busy?
Well, not monumentally.
Hmmm....
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
No.
Yeah.
Bye.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
You know what?
So what's your job this summer?
Mmmm.
Okay, bye.
What did you say?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
You're cold.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
How can I look at you and say this?
Say what?
Yeah.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Oh shit.
You do?
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
The guy with the Datsun?
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Your car?
Hang tough, Lloyd.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
How you doin', brother?
I don't really know where we are.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
War.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
You did, but you didn't.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
Stern.
I didn't do enough.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
That doesn't work, sir.
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
I won't.
Stop it...
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Why would you wanna do that?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Can we talk?
I did that.
Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
Not until you’re dead.
Did you do it?
You have a right to be angry.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
I think it's out of your control.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
What guy?
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
I really don’t like that comparison, honey.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
So we found a compromise.
Not good.
C'mon. Let's go.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
You're getting obvious.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
But who would operate your camera?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
..harmonica style is okay.
But she's standing right next to you.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
What?!
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
And who would that be?
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
What?  When?
No.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Why would the police come to you?
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
Honestly, my life.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
I'm hanging up right now.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
Who the fuck is this?
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Where the fuck did she go?
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
You sleep in THAT?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
It's been a year since she died.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
You have to move on, Sid.
It's okay. We need to talk.
Yeah... I think so.
What?
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
I don't know.
Who is this?
You're making popcorn?
No-bored.
Or else what?
No...
YES!
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Then what are you doing here?
What kind of lead?
I don't think you're so bad.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Should I be worried?
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Casey? Casey?
Not my daughter... not my...
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
About thirty seconds.
I want to talk to you.
Forget it.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
...out at the airport...
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
You coming tonight?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
What happened?
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Bye.
It's alright. I'll get it.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Oh, god...
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
I did. He's full of shit.
For once, Stu, drop it.
How's that?
Thank you.
I'm in.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Her pretty head.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
I realize that.
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
Is there any blood in it?
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
What?
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
It's got to be.
A switchblade.
Just wait!
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
I wish I still thought like you.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
We're focusing.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
What happened?
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
That part of me is dead.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
Really?
It's a hard place.
Did the wife confess?
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
Huh...? No...no water.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
You all settled an' comfortable now?
Whatchu doin'?...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Look?
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
I've seen her...and she's alive.
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
Making our very own solstice fire.
Maybe an animal.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Does this dog here belong to you?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
Thank you, Ned.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Right you are, governor!
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
No, no. You have a wife, children
No, your marriage bed.
That's me.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
So what do we do?
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
The one who came with your letter?
How goes it, Will?
Burbage says you have a play.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
"Of love?"
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Be still.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Stand up straight, girl.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
And I love poetry above all.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"Parting is such sweet sorrow…"
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Who is there?
You can bring them with a word.
I am.
Moonlight!
I must. I must
I was the more deceived.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Nor you for me.
You flatter, my lord.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
I am going to church.
She sings too?
But what of Lord Wessex?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
And what about you?
You know what I'm talking about.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Not eating what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
Well?
This is just an informal discussion.
I've never seen any of these men before.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
That's all?
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
She hated you --
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Did what?
I'm just looking.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
I don't thinkI can.
OK.
That's not him.
It tastes different.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Your painful groin?
No.
I'll wait there.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
There are only two other people in the flat.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
But they sneer, don't they?
You must be Juliet.
What's it about?
No. But he needs treatment.
For what?
That sounds fine.
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
What?
Look again if you like.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
What?
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
I gotta talk to you.
-- What?
Nummers.
I don't want to place you in any position --
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
What about?
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
Well she...
No.
Are you?
Then it's not your problem.
It isn't?
Okay.
Chopped liver?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
You are.
Yeah.
Right.
And you need money?
Oh fuck, Norman!
You would?
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
What?
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
-- we can't now.
I don't know what gets into me.
No you didn't.
You don't think so? I do.
He still having parties?
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
-- oh I thought you were --
-- ass and legs --
-- do you want ice?
I don't know... Jackie?
-- Oh yeah.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
I have to see you.
What're you talking about?
Who?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Okay.
When can I talk to you?
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
When I get off work.
I'll call you.
Bullshit.
I'm very tired, George.
I just want to know, that's all.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Does it make you happy?
Please!... that's not like you.
Did you?
What did you say?
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said --
I see.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
Layered?
What, do you think I planned it?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
I know.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
What?
I'll call you back.

A soap?
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
I am?
Then you were talking to him.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
I'll call you.
Anyway, you're crazy.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
We don't think marriage is important.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
Didn't you have any panties on?
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Is he an enemy?
Sort of.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
Three weeks.
You mean they ate each other up?
Yes?
Who's Tony?
Yes.
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
Are you having a bad dream?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Talking to Tony.
No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
No.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
Grady... oh.
Sure.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
Yes.
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away from me!
Stop it!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Uncle Al-
Sure, Uncle Al.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
Huh?
What if it's some kind of monster?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
What?
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Yeah! What is it?
Save this one for last.
A tracer. You'll like it.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
You know, I just might!
HE'S SO FINE...
And I'm tearful!
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
You know it.
What is it, Betty?
Look at that.  Get a gander.
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
Were you wicked?
Enough jabber.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Mary Robert.
I knew that.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
A bunch of real mama's girls.
Sing!
I... I...
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Really?
Mary Clarence!
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
We're nuns!
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Again?
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
What did He say?
Very well.
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Sit down.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Check your driver's license.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Would you like that?
No problem.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
Your cell.  Your room.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
In English?
Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
I must go where I can be of use.
You saved my life.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
Okay -- no limo.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
You're not... seeing anybody?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
I'm telling you!
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
She's praying.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Measles.
He's kind.
It's better than ice cream.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
You need to sleep.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Chosen me?
I shall, gladly.
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
The militia?
Believe?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Witches do not exist.  However...
Listen.
What happened?
Why this tree?
No.  They are all missing.
What books?
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Lady Van Tassel...
You are funny.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Must I hear this?
To avenge his father, and the others.
But, why?  Tell me why.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
I... I can't do this.
We have no choice.
Where?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Very little.  I must be going...
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
Yes.  Here...
She has confessed.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
You got any money?
All right then.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
What do you like to eat here?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
About a half a mile I think it is.
Okay. You don't have to though.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Don't tell me what to do.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
No sir.
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I thought I told you to keep out!
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Childers.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
Were they bad people?
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
All right then.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Naw.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Oh, jackin' off?
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Naw.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
A boy or girl?
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Mama?
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
I love you, too, Mama.
I ain't got no boy.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
We sure like havin' you.
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Do you smell shit?
Yes sir.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Signs?
I didn't mean that.
Why?
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
I'd love to.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
I didn't know you took pictures.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
Yeah, probably.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
Yes, I suppose I do.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
She looks just like you.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
And these?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
I shouldn't have let him go.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Of course. Where else?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Yeah, I can believe it.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
Two or three nights.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Take good care of yourself, okay?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
Thanks. 
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
And started to run.
Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
No wonder he was angry.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
Why not?
Well, it seems to me...
It seems human.  To me.
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
And what do you believe?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
No.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
For the third time, yes.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
With you.
With me?
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
Josephine and Geraldine!  Come on!
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
You better come help me.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Then pull the emergency brake!
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
What happened?
I'm engaged.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
Security.
Like what?
Oh.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
What?
Okay, Joe.
There you go with that we again.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Isn't that ridiculous?
How's the bottle?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
We better have a drink first.
No fair guessing.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
Come on, Daphne.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Yes.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
What's the big idea?
I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare.  Something I ate.  I'm not at all well.  See?  Hot water bottle.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
Most of the time I slap it.
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
You're leading again.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
We'll adopt some.
Thank you.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
Why?
Yes, we're the new girls.
Bingo?
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
That so?
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
For your own amusement?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
You're society girls?
I beg your pardon?
Tonight?
Oh?
You collect shells?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Shells?  Whatever for?
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
You're flattering me.
Have you tried?
Oh, no!
How can you think about food at a time like this?
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Let's make it an even million.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
You'll forget him, Sugar.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Big joke!
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
You shave with your spats on?
Spats Colombo.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Okay, Charlie.
Why wouldn't I?
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
I’m fine. I promise.
What for?
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
I’m a hooker.
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
Crikey.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
Why?
A weekend?
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Show me.
I’ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it’s the words: “morally repugnant.”
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Thank you.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
I’m so sorry.
I get all the glamour jobs.
Will do.
You don't live around here, do you?
I try...
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
Yes, mam...
Can you swim?
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
NO! N-O, NO!
No buts, Rita!
It's cold, Daddy!
Hi, Daddy...
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Goodnight to you, son...
Thank you, Daddy...
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Sunday...
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
David!
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Good night...
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Yes, ma'm...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Little chilly.
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
There are more important matters right now...
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
I hate the environment.
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
I saw him last night!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Okay.    Not.
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
The N word?
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
It's... It's not good children.
What?
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
That's gonna take a long time!
Kyle, check it out.
Sweet.
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
-Or monkey fucker-
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
Cheers, Terrance!
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
I am.
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
<u>WHAT?!</u>
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Cool!
Oh Sara...
Oh, thank you.
It certainly is.
They are awaiting further information.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
Over and out!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
I understand.
Ready as I'll ever be.
Yeah?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
But how are you going to escape?
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
And so far.
So I've been told.
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Right, I understand that...
A bowler.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
It's splitsville for you.
Lemme see your ball.
La da da dalala...
- canker sore.
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
See ya 'round Faz.
Wish me luck.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I'm getting to like it here.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
I am underground.
What about bowling?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
What ever happened to just bowling?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Bowling "Center"!
132, 154.
The Peter Pan.
I'm not here to - I can't...
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Kinda tough on the butt.
The mental hospital.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
We'll get into that later.
Why were you suspended?
He said he'd sponsor me.
Sheila, please.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't tell you, Theo.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
I'll be at the bridge.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Tell your little pal to let go.
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
It's burning...
Get out of there!
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Back away then.
Nobody move!
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What was that?
It's either that or we grow gills.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Storm?  What storm?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Hold on --
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
But sir --
-- and then brought her down here --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
Working on it now, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
Ladies and Gentlemen...
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
What -- are you threatening me?
Yeah.  Drowning.
My gosh, Norman.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Beth.
Where did you get this?
I have to reset the sub.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
The refridgerator.
That wasn't in there before.
None of this was here before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
But how?
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Nothing about drowsiness.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
Causes sleep.
You think I'd really drink that?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You're insane.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Top shelf, is it?
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
You holding up alright?
No, why don't --
Wait a second, I --
What noise?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
You know what it is, Harry.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
I'm trying.  There.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
But it's impossible.
Think about it.
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
"We are friends".
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
This is like nursery school.
Unless it's an act.
You seen my suitcase?
Four.  Four years --
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Could I learn to feel it?
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
He's bluffing...
He can't find Organa Major.
It could be worse...
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
Why didn't you say so before.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
With four casualties?!
They'll find its weakness.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Not enough, I guess.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Ace of spades.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Your father will never let you.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I got Games & Theory.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'm getting better.
Hey, check it.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
I'll meet you outside.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Shhh...
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
I'll go for that.
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
That was just a mix up.
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
Looks like rain.
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
I wouldn't mind.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
Precisely.
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Sure plan to.
You bet your life.
The people in New Hampshire.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
It's in your play.
Yes.
I understand...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Everyday things...yes.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Me?
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
Would you go in...
Oh.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
You believe that?
What's the scene...
<u>Please</u>...
...yes.
What?
Oh yeah.
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
But that's what happened.
Morning, darling.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Where have you been...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
You can go...
There's other things to be learned.
I, uh...  Um...
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the <u>wilds</u> sweetheart, you are in <u>error</u>...
I love Jewish men.
But we...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Did she throw up?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Doug...
This young woman.
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
My wife's going to have a baby.
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I hurt my finger.
I'm out.
No, what is it?
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
There's no witnesses...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
...not at all...
Mmm...
Ain't no second chances in life.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Why does Rachel scream?
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
Great.  Big ears, too?
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
No.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
If you want me to hate her I will.
And many meatballs.
No!  I have to get there.
Before you.
I helped.
Jackie, she was five minutes late --
Easy enough.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
And we all went through that together?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
I did it for her.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Don't flatter yourself.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
And I'm going to win.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Give 'em my number.
Aw.
Worked.  Like a charm.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
It's no biggie.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
I know that.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
You heard me: leave the table!
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Like what?
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
I'll be your guest!
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
No.
We had to work. My family was poor.
My Jesus…
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
I dunno.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
What's tomorrow?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Hi, Dad!
Ni...
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
No.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Great!
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Oh, that's too bad.
Anything I might know about?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
That's too bad.
Huh. Kids?
You know...I like you.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Doubt it.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
He did?
Well get someone down there!
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Shut up!
What do you mean?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
Dissent?
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
Get your men to do it!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
What does that mean?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
That's right, fella.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
What about the President?
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
Yes, sir.
You're right, sir.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
That is correct, Major.
You know the regulations well, Major.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Right.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Where'd they get you?
No kidding.
That's what I said.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
What happened?
Hell, he looks dead.
Quentin, how's your gear?
Recall what mistake?
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Look, this is different.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Like hell it does.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Roger.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Sure, King.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't anymore.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Mm-hm.
What's it about?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Okay, whatever you want.
That sounds so depressing.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Ah!
In the limo!!!
Good.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
I know, man.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Yeah, right, publicist.
Play it! Come on!
Yeah?
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
No, no, whoa!
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I could.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Mm-mm.
Deep down. Way down.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Oh, wow.
Hi, I'm Erica.
He's drunk.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
This is my home.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
That, that's Indian?
Come on!
I hate that.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
To his hotel?
Oh, fuck it, man!
What?
Just go.
Good, man.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah.
For a while.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Get off my property!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Yeah.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Hey.
Yeah?
Oh, no, man. I can't.
That's because I am.
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Whatever.
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Jeff!
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
You just became a statistic!
Cleo!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
We're here for you, Diane.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
That you?
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Or, I could get my own horse...
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Hold on...
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
I didn't mean to --
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
How about the Rainbow Room?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
With a wildly beating heart.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
I was afraid of that.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
So do I.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
Who's who?
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
I just don't.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Come on in, Betty,
Whose house is it?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Nobody asked you to.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Gordon Cole?
It's a good script, isn't it?
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
They'll love it in Pomona.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
December twenty-first.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
I'll come early tomorrow.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
What scene?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
What's wrong with It?
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Why do you say that?
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
And she's turned you into a servant.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
This is the staircase of the palace.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
It's what we were warned about.
Am I? Still?
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
Whatever you say.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
I have to.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
Who didn't?
Let me kiss you.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
And you think you're in love.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
I could force you.
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
Yeah.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?
Theories?
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Yes.
Oh, sure.
As brave as my father. As wise.
You're not...an orphan are you?
Must've been a defective puck.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
I'm Linda Lee.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I don't scare that easily.
For what?
What? Palace? Hardly.
Then come with me.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Zaltar!
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Nope.  Never. 
Brad Wilson.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
But Lana, you could --
Me??
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Oh. You're going away.
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Thirty-five.
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
First paycheck?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Which country?
Me? How?
When?
First question got to be "Where."
What are you talking about, fella?
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Fair's fair.
Anything.
Sister! I'm his sister!
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
What about me?
What about you?
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
He can have mine. Anytime.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Why do I have to do this?
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
Today coffee----
We already have a super-tanker.
Don't cry, Bubba.
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Lois, I . . .
We'd better talk.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
Lois, someday --
Everything on it.
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Yes.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Where?
North.
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
What do you want?
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
North. Keep going North!
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
Sentimental idiot.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
I really don't think . . .
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
I'm not so sure you do.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
This wasn't in the plan.
Lucky I brought my drums.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
What do you fear?
Destiny.
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
One of them should've been you.
I know.
North. It's north
No.
Not really, no.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Unbelievable.
He may have a gun!
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
I just took a shot at it.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Jealous? Of what?
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
No, you're going to get kissed,
You?! How about me?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
What other one?
But so is Vond-El
And if I don't obey?
-- as we will be.
No! You couldn't imagine -
He is. Usually.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I guess they are a little odd.
How much do you weigh?
I...uh...check.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
But...why?
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Which one?
Then...when did she get better?
What happened?
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
Was it good?
Why did you do that, Billy?
Did his parents attend to that?
Did they give him special care?
Yes.  He does.
Billy said that?
What other people?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I didn't say that.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
No.  A little sugar though.
I'll...take it straight.
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
Who's Mr. Stephens?
It's the truth.
Did he say what about?
What's a ditty again?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
So he was mean?
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
Indian?
What do they do?
Perfect.
Here we go.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
I tested positive.
No.
You think someone else caused the accident?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Do you like the colour?
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Great.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
But of course...
Alone or surrounded?
Hurry back.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
I said Sidney!...
No...
I don't believe it.
I didn't say that, J.J.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
He means that much to you...?
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Wild?  Take a look at them and see who's wild...
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
What sort of thing?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Nothing...
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
Cool.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
No.
No problemo.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Where you going?!
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Why him?
Why attack Russia?
On all what?
I don't know.
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
Five minutes.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
Yeah.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Did you call someone you knew?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
What did Goering say?
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
I don't understand what you mean.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
What?
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
Come to the office, please.
You know your weapons, buddy.
Wrong.
Don't wear the beige one.
Right.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
You must have had a fun child-
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
Why?
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
Send a unit.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
Projections were far too optimistic.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
What?
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
Keep it.
Seriously?  What did they say?
I thought...
What's wrong?
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
What... what do you mean?
Who's responsible?!
... what... ?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
They'll be wanting it back.
Never better.
You shouldn't have.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
This isn't an escort service?
Like a stroke?
But, will you?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
It always is.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
What's all this for?
That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Where's my brother?
His behavior... ?
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
Why?
No.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
All night?
I, I just can't...
It was very specific.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
That?  That's Hill House.
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
-- but the painting!
Then let's go get you one.
I'm not.
I'm a gracious host.
Why not?
This is un-fucking professional.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
Huh?
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
She didn't write to me, did she.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Not me, man.
Not much -- you?
Didn't get it.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
Why not.
Are you serious.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
You don't believe it was a car accident.
I'll bloody well ask him.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
I can see the attraction.
Hey?
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Who remembers.
Overnight.  What about just now?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
Up the coast.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
How do you know?
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Of the deal, man.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
The forever kind.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
I don't know.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
What's in it?
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Since when?
I miss my kids.
I don't.
Ann--
Who?
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Hello, Birdy.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Ah.
I don't understand.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Yeah.
No, Dave, I wasn't.
Uh-huh.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
...Huh?
I didn't say a word.
Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
Yeah.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
I'm fine.
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Yeah, yeah--go home.
This hair.
What the hell are you talking about?
What'd he say?
Birdy...
It better be good.
Oh Jesus...
Where the hell are you?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Call me Vince.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
We will.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Like this.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
What kind of hormones?
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
What was it?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
How?
Where exactly?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
No, hold back...
Sweep the harbor.
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Do it!
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
That and a fat, new contract.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
The memory of who?
Shhh!
You think she'd go through with it?
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Yeah, what happened?
--Truman, what are you doing here?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Really?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
The thing that started all of this.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
Did something happen today?
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
I don't know--
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
I bet you did.
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Yup.
Penetration but not perforation.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Of what?
Into what?
Who?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
No. Don't bother.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
You a reporter?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Before the bomb went off?
That's what I'm saying.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
Negotiating with whom?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
I've been using you?!
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
Did you find something?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They were the ones that put us together.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
Why not? It's three AM.
I was until about an hour ago.
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
And you've never seen anything like that?
Where would they be going?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Been where?
Maybe. Maybe not.
I don't know.
You can't quit, Scully.
Just like that --
I need you on this, Scully --
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
I don't have his number.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
How deep does this go?
I have answers for you.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Driver.
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Give a kiss to Edward.
I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
I got it.
Yes.
Absolutely.
No.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
Next time, tell me, okay?
Ja, ja, ja.
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
He has a little dog.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Just another part I've got to learn.
Well you read this.
Tell me more.
Have you?
There isn't enough for two laughs.
I'm sorry.
Why are you lying?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
No.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
No, sorry.
It wasn't petrol.
I'm not asking you to.
Thank you. Excuse me.
How about the doorway?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
Of course.
Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Oh, Mr. Martins...
No, a major, were you really?
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Yes.
Did the police believe you?
Do you expect me to give myself up?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
I have guests waiting.
English?
And?
Now, hold on.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
What else?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Help you out?
Just five dollars, please.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
So how many miles do you think it is?
A fin!
What happened?
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
Incredible.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
That's a movie, you moron.
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.
I just read it....
You want it to be an event.
That's stupid. Why would they?
He's at a home out here.
No.
Oh, yeah... 
What's it mean?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
What's it about?
I told you, I'm good at this.
You want a punch in the mouth?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
And be crushed.
I didn't realize you cared.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
It's the truth....
What's that?  Okay. Surprise us...
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
Female...
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Get the fuck away from me.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
It was a nine millimeter.
But I wasn't.
Don't tell me what I --
Balint?
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
You could do it.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Four. But no one this important.
What's that?
Exactly.
We think you'd be good at it.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
What?
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
No.
What kind?
... So am I.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Because you'd laugh.
How many are, down there?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
The rules are the rules.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Fine!
Great!
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
... You married?
... Yes.
Thank you, thank you very much!
Well that's very nice of you.
Thank you...
Uh... Ah!  A story?
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
... Not at all.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
... Sally?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh!
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Keep going.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
Do what you must.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
Mazel Tov!
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
No, it was the perfect level.
I don't know —-
You get your money from your husband.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Who?
Tomorrow -—
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
No.
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
You're too good to me.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Maybe I want to feel badly.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I got into a little crap game.
What! You can't be --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
How do you know?
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
The dead can wait.
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Can you tell me how you spell...
You’re a long way from home...
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn’t have any. I used a British passport. My name’s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
By your Austrian?
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I’m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But he’s a good guy. He’ll listen to you. He won’t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
How much of a hurry are you in?
You... Fuck you!
B-Black...
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
It’s not.
What if it is?
Then why aren’t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Does it matter?
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...
What is?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
Have you?
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
Can I get up now?
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Fine...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
Alors quoi?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Shut up and walk...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
I -- I don't understand...
We have to press home the attack!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
And when was that?
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
Scared of a girl?
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
No no, I'm fine, really...
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Yes.
Many things...
No... I want to be confessed.
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
You think?
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
The English won't wait.
No good?  This is a disaster!
No... not like this...
That's now what I meant...
I'd sooner die than use magic!
If you kill him, you kill me!
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I don't think so.
Let's see.
Oh yes... very.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Who is this "he"?
He never says his name.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
It's nothing.
Really?
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
I'll see you...soon.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Who told you?
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
Just shut up.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Why didn't you come to me?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
Where do you live?
To be deaf?
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
That is good, yes.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
Nothing just yet
I don't want to learn.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
You mean in signs?
No, words. You have never heard words?
Spoken words?
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He chopped it off
Do I know any gigs?
All right if I look around your lobby?
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
Here.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
I had some appointments.
What?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Then why ain't he dead?
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
Mottola.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
Why?
Then you'll do it?
Neither are we.
Did he hold you up on anything?
I thought I'd lost him.
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
Yeh.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
I'll square it with the fixer.
But I got a train to make.
Where you goin'?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
Maybe a couple million.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
You weren't hired to miss him.
For fifteen years.
Never heard of the place.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
He's just around the corner.
Nothing.
Another young man.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
You're high enough.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
This is my wedding.
It's a promise?
Only in bad weather.
What's he want of you?
What's that to you?
Keep on asking.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
What do you mean?
He's holding out on you.
Nunheim!
Extraordinarily lucky.
Could this be him?
I'll take care of him.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
I'll get some.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
What did you do with the rest?
That's all right.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
No word at all?
That's all right.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
By the way, how is your father's side?
That last Martini.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Yes.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
Want a drink?
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
Well, didn't you?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
What's the matter with you?
What are you going to do?
You bet I wouldn't.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi...
You worked here?
Bonds, sir?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Who fired you?
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
Wha...
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Break it out.
What about the gold?
Maybe we should split it up now.
Maybe I do.
Why'd he come in our camp.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
I out rank you, that's why.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
What about Jaeger?
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
You can't tell anybody about this.
...I know.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Epps...
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
Something like that.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
It's giving.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
We can't just leave him.
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
We go this way.
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Then I'm a rich man.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Yeah, you're funny.
What?
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
Oh, no.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
He lived through that?
I'm not wasting my water on him.
You want to say some words?
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Now?
But...you...
You don't know.  You don't....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
No!...No!...
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
Impossible!
Incredible!
What?
What kind of answer is that?
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
Where's LUH?
Look more closely.
I'm only trying to help you.
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Hang on.
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Treat. We treat devices.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Bingo!
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Right.
Your partner?
Be right back.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
Stay here.
Shut up!  Who is this?
Take him!
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
Yeah, just a nick ...
IRA - instant retirement account.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
I know.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No.
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I've got to see you.
What is it?
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
Thank you!
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
The pepper, too?
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke--all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>--why take a chance on jewelry?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
You're hired!
Um-hum ...
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Like that!
I <u>must</u> go.
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
And you expect me to believe that?
Giron...!
Divine ...
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
No, m'sieu!
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Naturally not!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
That's right.
The pumps --
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
I'm tryin' boss.
Get that outta my face.
Don't drop it Rose.
Rush her.
Don't you mean work me?
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
She knows.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
She had beautiful hands.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
You're still my best girl, Cora.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Now it's worse.
Right.
It's so cold.
I'm so cold.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
Yes sir.
You think she was really there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
Sure!
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Not at all.
Sure!  Excuse me.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
I'll say she is!
Very much--
How about giving me another coat?
There's soft music--
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
Don't rub it in.
Okay.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Why, I--
What's that?
June? That's my wife's name.
Who won?
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Well, he has a straw hat--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
I wish I could.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Thank you.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I'll explain later--
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Well now that's a little more Like it.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
No...
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
There's no reasoning with him.
Colorado's closer
How is he?
Never even heard of anything like it.
I laugh sometimes
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Always?
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Drop his horse.
But this time they'll be ready.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Yeah?
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
You'll never make that stick.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Wyatt...
Yeah, and dangerous.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
- We all want what we can't have?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Just hold me.
Not from forty feet.
Of course.
What?
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Are you listening to me?
Don't say it.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Yes, M.
Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -
I understand.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
Stop it!
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
I was an attorney!
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Oh here we go with that.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
He will be alright.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Go back to sleep.
Just stay in bed and rest.
What happened to your hand?
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
Well, I would appreciate that.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
My mother passed on years ago.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
He is in his pigeon cage.
Yeah!
You can bring ONE toy...
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Watch yourself!!
No, you can't.
You mean that happy child?
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose!!
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
What?!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Stay calm, everyone!!
I can't see a thing!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Last present!

That's right.  Your toys.
Speed up!
Slink!  Hang on!
There's no mirror.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Get away from me...
What did I do wrong?
I'm cold.
Finn ...
It was only a mouthful!
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
Juliet who?
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
I mean, did you ask her?  What kind of drugs has she tried?
Well, I hope it stays that way.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Nine thousand dollars.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
What?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Caroline --
Not yet.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Oh, yes I can.
Parents still together?
Do you work?
In school?
Yeah.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
I don't know.
No --
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
Yes, sir!
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
What?
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I just saw him.
Only if he can be trusted.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I don't know what to say.
You won't say anything to my parents?
What?
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
What do you mean?
Shag her senseless.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
Can you not go yourself.
Jesus.
What's your name?
Eh-
Ssshh!
Holding hands?
No, not holding hands.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Certainly not.
Is that a promise, then?
Happy birthday.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Sorry about last night -
It's no problem.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
And you might get the fucking job.
Roald Dahl.
Say something, Mark, say something --
What?
You know.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
Stick it on my tab.
Such as?
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
Put it on the screen.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
MM.?
Are we leaving, Captain?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Captain.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Let me do something.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Uh-uh.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
I don't control minds. I free them.
You are mad!
Spock...

I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
I cannot go with you.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
To warn him.
For being on to Dillinger.
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
They'll start to soon enough.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Ok
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Not a chance.
Let's get outta here.
Flynn?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
Meanwhile, he might find it.
End of line.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
You wouldn't dare.
User requests are what computers are for.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Yeah, I... oops!
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Let's get some power here.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Tron...?
Alan-One...
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
We have to.
Then I owe you some thanks...
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Out.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
What?
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Son of a bitch!
She's having an affair.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
The purse is still at the house.
I wasn't cheating!
It's certainly... dramatic.
You're damaged goods, lady.
Sure.  Say that now.
Okay.
Yeah, it was wild.
Yeah.  It was great.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
Do you still love your husband?
I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
Yes or no.
No.  Doris.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
I don't take those assignments.
Dance?
Use 'em and lose 'em.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Helen.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
He wants to speak with you.
You can't have just one.
Get it.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
Yes, I would.
How long have you worked here?
Five.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
You have a pimp?
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
I don't believe so.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
What?
Really?
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Naw naw!
You got it.
Ask him if he got the letter.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Good for you.
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
What's this acting class guy's name?
Let me handle this.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
I bullshitted him.
I really don't know.
What makes you think I could do that?
You were a cop.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Keep it.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
They didn't tell me.
Sure.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
Pussy love pink rocks.
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
Donowitz, he said.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
So that...???
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
I need to go.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
Underground.
What year do you think it is?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
Lock it now!
I thought I was in...prison again.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
What's that mean?
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
Then how come she knows what's going on?
Might be tight.
You want something?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Christ no!
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
But he's dead.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You believe that?
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
You got the money?
You got beer?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Yes.  Yes it is.
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
Wrong number.
There's someone in the house.
Jake.  No.  No!
Maybe I don't want you to.
What?
Beautiful?
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
You live pretty good.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
What about him?
But you said we could be together.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
I think I busted my leg.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
I'm her husband.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Like you don't know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Hungry?
About things.  About your wife.
I do.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You're talking like a mad man.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
And what does that make you?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
That's a thick change of heart.
Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Not from where I stand.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Get away from me!
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
A hundred-forty-five really.
And John, don't make me come look for you.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Soda.  You know.
No police!
That's 'cause he's dead.
I think I've heard that before.
Who's cursed?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
You afraid of the dark?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
A lot that means.
It ain't broke.
Yeah...
I'm a solid man.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Live there?
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You're talking like a madman.
And what does that make you?
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Nope.  Darrell.
So?
Darrell--
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
How much!?
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I like that about me, beautiful.
May I carry your package, Grace?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Where you headed?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
You know what I want.
Walk away.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
I think I burned my gun hand!
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Like you helped her, Jake?
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Four.
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Jesus.
We're supposed to be honest.
What about the game?
I don't know Megan.
Seventy-five percent.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
You're skill.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
How much can you lift?
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
Fine.
No.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
Where is it?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
But what they done, they...
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
He give 'em names?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
Oh.
Oh yeah.
Uh... a little, maybe.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
All week?
They really got all that money, them whores?
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
You were there?
Did you... kill him?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
About what?
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
You still think he's in there?
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah?
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
You're marking us, Bill.
How far kin you see?
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Easy, Bill.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Three.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
We'll bury him.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Just like that?
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
What do you care what he says?
I can run. I got no problem with that.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Fenster and Hockney?
This I had to see myself.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
You're lying.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Business or personal?
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
You know damn well what I think.
I just want to hear your story.
You got him wrong.
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
Right.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Edie.
I knew him. He would never -
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Yes.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Say it.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
I know of him.
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
I am seventy-four years old.
I'm on the staff of...
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
'Code Blue'...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
And you wrote that...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected ...
I understand.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Why is that?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I had a witness disappear on me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
I can't guarantee that...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
The TV didn't work.
Maybe I can do something right.
What...?
What happened...?
...and is that serious?
No, no, I'm just...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Not if you don't grow up...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Stop pressuring me...
I have to talk to you.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
Don't touch anything.
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
What?
Right.
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
Yeah.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
... I know.  I went ...
How old is he?
Yes.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?
No, I'm all right.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Well?
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
What happened?
Did she hurt herself?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
What about?
Why?
Let me come in.
Tomorrow morning.
No.
That's not very complimentary, either.
Why?!
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
You can.
No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Wherever you'd like...
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
How does it work?
Can't you see?
Scottie --
Take me away...
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
I don't know... Switzerland?
I loved you, Madeleine.
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
No birds live here.
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
Would you know the room?
What else?
Yes --
Madeleine --
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Please answer my question.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Johnny, the doctors explained --
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Three whole weeks.
Sorry, old man. Work.
My... the acrophobia.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
What did you say?
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Why?!
You're pathetic.
You're a loser.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
I don't give a damn.
Adam! Calm down.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
What happened? Oh my God...
It has to be done.
What.
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Where's the bathroom?
Who's up for making some real money?
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
He's having a problem here.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
I don't know...
Hear what?
Okay fine.
The hell I did!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Moore?
True.
What?
They need leadership.
Not really, no.
I love you.
Government cutbacks.
We missed the deadline.
Can't we do it on the phone?
I don't think so.
The wedding cake check?
Photographer?
Yup.
I think I forgot the tent.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
He's weird.
I've seen it on television.
I need your help.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
I love you.
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
Are they fighting?
Can we just talk this out?
I know.
No.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
What are you talking about?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
But...
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
I got to agree with that.
A move?
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
It was an accident!
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
Then it's a respectable house.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Yes, it is.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
A black bull came.
Mother.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
Hello.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Their weapons missing?
You're...such a wimp.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
It feels so.. .real.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
All my work is my finest.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
A little less than yesterday.

Authority still makes me nervous.

Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
I've got some final preparations to take care of—— Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
What if he's busy tonight?
...on the way in.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
What'd ya think?
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
Come on.
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
It won't hold.
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Tell me again.
The American "people"?
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
What do you know about them?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
The Hostages...?
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
<u>So</u> forth...
Knock on wood.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
...brazen-it-through...
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Remember the Maine...
...going to War...
Because.
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
They got him standing by.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
The Albanian Campaign.
Uh...
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
An anti-psychotic...
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron.  Want to thank you.
I'm looking for a phone...
See y'at the Finish Line.
We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
Better.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
Show some compassion.
Please, no thanks... 
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Oh really.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
Don't start, alright.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
What if they call him?
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
So you're hot on this stock?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Okay.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
...Gordon.
How much?
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
You really do believe in destiny?
I'll let you know.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
...how do you know? You wish...
Oh Christ!
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
Businessman?
What's that?
Ok toots, I will.
Thank you
Thank you
What?  Tony and China, together?
A little?
Right.
Well divide 18 into three
Six six and six
Sell my soul?
They're all human beings
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Hey.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Do you really think so?
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
You think that'll help?
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
No.
Almost.
At the party.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
You're the flower lady.
Um...yes.
And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
I can't, no, no, I can't...
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
Do we have to?
You got it.
Jody, no...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
I don't know.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
I know.
What is it?
Three o'clock.
How is it?
Nope.
Yup.
To make sure she's all right.
Did you call the police?
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
I didn't do that.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Oh.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
The accident...?
Call ya later.
We walked all night...
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
What's the matter?
Claire--
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
How did she know where it was?
It's alright.
She can't be here without me.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Do you know it?
You don't have to do that.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Mauduh...
MADISON!
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
The lamplight.  That's all.
You're a monster.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
He just went out like & light-

I'm glad you're around to say it.
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
Captain's orders.
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
I don't think of us that way - ever.
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
On which planet...?
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
And it can't be forged?
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I really don't know what to say
Sure...
I'm a dentist
And how many people have you killed?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
At 2.00...
Yes I can...
No worries
Yes, come on in...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
You go first.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
So that's a maybe?
Do it?
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Hmmm?
What do you want me to do?
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
My legacy.
I meant biologically.
I didn't forget.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I'm trying to help.
Really? You wanna write about me?
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
He didn't. He had it built.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
I'm trembling with excitement.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Maybe someday.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
You promise you'll finish school?
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
I'm warning you.
I was like a different person tonight.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
I'm just a messenger.
Kelly.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
I know you do.
Take your time.
He was large?
Try, Kelly.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Unless what?
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
I net a guy in a bar.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
Police -- God -- get a life.
Hi, Mon.
Sam!  Hi!
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
In back of the garage.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
I just want my life back...
Just like that?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Story's the same, Detective...
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Yes.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Oh, I would hope not.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Yes!
They're coming.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
You're not a woman.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Are you a warrior?
What is it?
Friend of yours?
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Where the hell did you come from?
Nursemaid?!
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Well what did she say?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Watch it!
What do I need for that?
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
Shut up.
I don't know much about him.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Milking?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Sorry. It's important.
Pretty much.
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Are they going to kill you?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
Who else knows?
They kid a lot.
I would not be too sure.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Home.
Only the elders.
Two days.
But you can't.
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
A real fireball.
Not long... A few days.
There was.
It won't happen again.
Wrong.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
John said you're Amish.
God, Fred...
His name is John Book.
That is idle talk.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
You have no right here!
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
No --
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Yes.
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
If any!
Oh ....
Oh ....
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Aw, come, come, come --
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Oh --!
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
No, but you tried to.
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
The nerve.
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Because I'm still scared!
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Did I scare you?
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Where's Kansas?
Um-hmm.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
The other side....
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
It did?
Somebody pulled my tail.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
You mean she bit you?
Now, now, don't fret.
We'll get you together!
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Yes.
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
So who are you?
If I don’t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden’s Tower, M is dead.
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
I took the initiative.
The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Yes.
It’s the only way out...
I know.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
You can drop the act, it’s over.
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
You turned Renard.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
And the payoff on the tables?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
How appropriate.
I’d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
Why?  What's the problem?
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Washington?
Don't call me that.
Wrong answers?
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Cured, yes.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
Good night.
She's with me.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Play one.  Educate yourself.
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
You and me.
Okay!
They're practically on us . . .
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
. . . What??
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
Isn't it true that you --
I don't know their real names.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Is that a fact?
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
How will you fix it?
The scum of the Earth.
What do you get if you finish?
Like what?
Yorgi asked me to.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
That's would be me.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
Here we go again.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
You wanna see my politics?
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
Beast.
For what purpose?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
What are you talking about?
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Not interested.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
You mutant bastards...
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
Deal.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?
Enough for a test.
What do you mean to do?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
... No!
MMmmm.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
MMmmm.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Promise??
Darling!
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
This is the only library I know of.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
I beg your pardon?
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
My father was a sick man.
What hump?
I thought you wanted to.
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Home.
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
It's the only way.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
What a filthy mess.
And look at this, Doctor!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
I think I'll...carry him.
Are you serious??
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Good night!
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
Nor to Elizabeth.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
