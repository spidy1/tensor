No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
What's normal?
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Never
So -- which Dakota you from?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Will Bogey get bent?
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
You told me that part already.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You and Verona?
You think this'll work?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Pick you up Friday, then
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You're not a big talker, are you?
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know who The Raincoats are?
I know, just let me sleep
This is so patronizing.
Do what?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Fallacy.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
No.
No, I won't go with you
It's just something I had.  You know
Wait I...
I thought you were punishing me.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You're completely demented.
Have a great time, honey!
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
You come!  You speak first!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Colon!
All of them!  Just lies!
I am listening, my son.
I believed in you...
Oh?  So you are a new man?
We don't need to know.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
What do you read?
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You think I don't know that?
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
I was all of these.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
But it's...
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
What are you asking me?
What are you doing?
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Who did cause and origin?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
End my career?
When?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Nah, I musta missed it.
Nah, why should you?
What would you call her?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
This isn't homicide school.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Is it drug related?
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
You promise?
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Thank you.
That's unique.
Keep them out of my way.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Hi, I'm Honey.
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Is there a problem?
Who is he?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
What is it?
Credit?
Robert...?
Yeah?
Yes...he's my friend.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
No.  Go ahead.
No way!  He's mine!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Aren't you tired?
How was it?
Your doctor?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Okay. 
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
What is it, Hal?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Yes, it is.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
CONINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
And your charming little daughter?
How is gregor?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
That's right.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
True.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Five by five, Frank.
Vodka.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I want to drive awhile.
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Hello, again.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Would you guys...
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
What do you think?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Hey, you wanna bet?
Let's go.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Stall.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Rosalie, you okay?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
Of course.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
I don't have time... I need to know.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Hello?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
What did you say? What did you do?
Is that all?
I'm not going.
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
...Like love...
Have you identified it?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Is that better?
Recommendations.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Hello?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
What happened to you?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You don't understand...
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What do you want?
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
That's five thousand dollars.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Machine.
We can do that.
Where are the women?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
I know what you did.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
How much did he pay you?
Why?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
That's right.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Yeah... guess so.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Sounds good, pops.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
My condolences.
No.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm telling you it's not that.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
Nothing remotely like this.
You told me to look, so I looked.
Yes, but...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
What are you talking about... ?
No... no... no...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
No, you may not.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
You alright?
We'll figure it out.
You what?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
It was Freddy.
Been up with Alice.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
Where is he?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Poor woman...
I don't understand.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
You could train someone else.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
We're stuck tight!
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
There's got to be an explanation!
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
Who with?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Well, I'll be - !
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Who?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Yeah.
On your sleeve.
Why do they do that?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
No what?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
So?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Maybe.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Okay. She's fine.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
What way?
I know your parents.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Coffee's perked.
Can --?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Crawl!
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Who?
Get some sleep.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
What about Margie?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Which is?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Well, I never heard that one.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Daddy...
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
It's cut.
They aren't answering their hails.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
We've already been inspected.
Dead.
Who did this?
How?
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
A dubious distinction, no?
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
I know he left you behind.
That was war.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
May I speak to you for a moment?
You know what?
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
The fax machines.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
who can I say is calling?
Thank you for calling the white House...
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
I was reading too.
Elaine.
Te...!
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
What will happen to him, Ted?
I mean for Ted.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
My career is shot.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Captain Oveur?
You folks need any help?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
You've been hurt.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Surely you can't be serious.
That's right.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Good-bye, darling.
He's right on the heading.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Yes?
Roger.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Excuse me, Sister?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
You are Cassandra?
You don't have squat.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Let's talk Hubley.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Get the picture?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
I believe he is probably lying.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
I'm going home.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Shit!
Harcourt is dead.
We can't let him get away.
Only holds five.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Position?
And it's too late to shut it down?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Amy.
I get the picture.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Save it.
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Seventeen meters.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
It's inside the complex.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Burke!  Open the door!
I knew you'd come.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Indeed.
Yes.
Why not?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
And how will you make him keep it?
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Ui-vol-i-tub!
You borrowed money from your mother?
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Yes, my love?
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
No. Don't answer it!
Give me one reason I can understand.
Excellency!
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
He asked me to stay.
This is not his handwriting.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Gertrude!
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Yes, where?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Yes, Sire.
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
That's not what I hear.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Why not?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
What?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Ah!
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Herr Sommer.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Of course not.
I'm afraid not.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
But what is it they don't like?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Are you neglecting my request?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
Who?
Oh, yes.
Also identical?
And that's all?
You go fast!
I am so ashamed.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
What do you want?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
About the ballet.
Bravo, Your Majesty!
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Who is she?
How did he look?
He said 'Jack'.
He's not?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Yes, I should think so.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
I beg your pardon?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
What? Oh, yes, please.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
That's easy enough.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
I'm a werewolf.
Closet.
Lovely.
I was awake and he was in my room.
But, David.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
How are we feeling tonight?
He all right?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
All right, you two, move along.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
How long have I been here?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
I really don't know.
You're not having a good time are you?
It's a five-pointed star.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
What the hell was that all about?
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
What's the plan?
Plan?
It's in front of us.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Stop it, Jack.
Nurse!
What are you doing here?
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Get out of here, Jack!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
What can I say, Jack?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
Hello, Tom.
Matt?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
I remember once when your account checked.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
The theatre?
Got my letter?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
Why pick on him ?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
What'll we do?
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yes.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
Oh, Matt . . .
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Mr. Williams . . .
Are you sure?
Huh?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
This is healing?
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Swear.
Yesterday.
Oh no...
Damn!
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
She had a moustache.
It was exciting.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
The James-Younger Gang.
Sorry.
Sure, cousin.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Yep.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Where is Jesse James?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Then why can't I go in there?
That would have made an impression.
I figure.
I reckoned.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
"Big and older"?
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
This has been a good year.
And we're good at it.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
They're making him a hero now.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
What?
Don't swear.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Last February?
You cocky little bastard.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Thank you.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
They had to be dealt with!
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
It is a nice piece of writing.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
This is Dorsia?
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Really?
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
He's good-looking.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Yes, I am.
How did you guess?
Doesn't he live here?
Are you sure?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
It looks so soft.
Patrick?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
We are totally booked.
Oh? And what should I say?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Patrick?
Yes, Patrick?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Jean? Sorbet?
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Coffee?
No, really. I'm okay.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
No.
People just...disappear.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Let's see...  That you were with-
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Marcus?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
I'm hungry
I'm hungry.
Shhhh...it's okay.
It's...it's...all right.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
It's important.
...But?
Didn't you visit the campus?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
He's your boss. He's not your --
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
...wanna savor this.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Right... What's that mean again?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
I do!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
You've been coming in early.
The wrong place?
I'm okay. It's going well!
You could've handwritten it.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
You do?
Just thought his work should go on.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Why would you do a thing like --
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Oh.
I met this girl.
Speaking of which...
Who're these guys?
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
To my health.
Where am I?
Right away, Exposition.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Be careful.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
What's wrong with your hand?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me?
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Are you crazy?
Austin, I'm coming with you.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Here, have a piece of gum.
Noooooooooooooo!
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Blow me.
Why?
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Flower ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
As you see.
I have an appointment.
Rules are made to be broken.
Then who wins?
Hmmm ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
To find out who killed my husband.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
I'm already married ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
The result would be ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
And just what is the game?
Much better.
My father always wanted a boy.
Do you?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
I could save you the trouble.
And do you trust me?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
No, after you.
Aren't you coming?
It's called Black Leather.
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Our chaperon.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
I see.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Makes two of us.
I was getting to it.
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
How did you guess?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
John Steed.
One shot -- for emergencies.
What's happening?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
What are we having?
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Let's get naked.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
I want women.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Oooooo.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Reach out and snort someone.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
My Debbie?
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Just come down, John. Just --
-- He killed people --
Not likely.
Why'd you come here, Brian?
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Thanks for the insight.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
-- What were they doing there?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Thanks for calling.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
How's it going?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Well, you did invite me here.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Thanks for the invite.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Leave Stephen out of this --
Hi.
I don't know anything about it.
What'll you do?
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did I say thanks?
Your brother was a good man.
Yeah.
Brian?
Four months.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Investigator Rimgale.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
All right, cop. I want my money.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
...Benedict Arnold...
Give me some?
You don't have the demographics.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
You might be right.
I'm not smiling.
What's that?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
What's wrong with him?
De-la-croix.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
And I'm the feet.
I would like to change your name.
Mantan?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Sounds risky to me.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Which one is your brother?
You've said that already.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
This is crazy.
Don't make me have to use this.
Hi, Mona.
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
You feel good, not nervous?
So they can be on TV.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
No.
I don't believe it.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
You've never had any formal training, either?
You sing and dance?
...then what about...
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
A lot?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Oh you do, huh?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
All Europe shall hear of this!
I have no luggage.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Then you yield to me.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
You want my heart?
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Good night, papa.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
The milkmaid's daughter?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Dark Valdez.
He loves me, as I love you.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
What do we do?
You killed him you fucking faggot --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
What the fuck is going on?
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
So you killed him?
Why?
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
You're lying --
Full clip to the body --
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
No. I said Dunbar.
How do you know?
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Yes.
Why?
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
You're kidding.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Watch me.
Little bit.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
We were close to something with Kendall.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
So you took off your shirt?
Pike never confessed.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
I used it to start the fire --
What do you think?
Who is she? Where does she live?
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
Bloom like a flower?
Yes.
You get the eye?
Don.
How would you describe him?
How old are you?
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
It's okay, just leave it.
I know.
Really.
That's terrible.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Okay.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
You owe me three-fifty.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
What?
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
How did you get so many?
Are you Jenny Hill?
You didn't become crazy.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
You first.
The sets were good.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
You must have a visa or something...
Uh. Do you like England?
When?
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
You can stay tonight.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He wants the money from your bank.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Yes.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
They go. John. They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
You don't understand anything.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
What?
Have you got your passport?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Fine.
So uh...
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
No.
We'll pretend it never happened.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
What?
You don't have to say anything
I don't have nothing.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
You know you can come under the blanket.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Is the flight full?
How do you want to pay?
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You didn't have to do this.
That'd be nice.
What do you need?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Let go of my arm...
LAZ, I said let...!
Two days?
Well I don't...
Don't need none.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
Could you do somethin' for me?
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
What I love.
I don't want you to let go.
What'chu sayin'?
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Why's his britches round his knees?
Ain't gonna be moved?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Why she got a chain on her?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Hey.
Are you wasted?
What?
What happened to your face?
Got in a little accident.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
The hell you call me?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Maybe we should do something?
What are you doing?
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
This the right place?
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
You cool, Ich?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Give me a break, would you?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
You must leave?
Know her?
What's he saying?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Ichiro --
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
No...
Let's go.  Him first.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
I don't know.
What's that for?
I need someone to translate for me.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
No one's keeping him here.
I still think you're a bastard.
Why?
Why me?
He was my partner.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
Could you fill me in?
You had my help, detective.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
He knows what he's doing.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
But not to last.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
I think, therefore I am.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Why, yes, of course.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
You want to see my friends?
These aren't just...
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Why didn't you go?
Too old.
Who?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What's suck night?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
Why should I be?
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
You did?
Hmmm?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Uh-huh.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What's up?
Thanks.
May I ask a personal question?
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
How come you were in my truck?
I don't have one.
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
No, I'm lost.
I came on a bus.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
It's Perry!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
No.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Two weeks.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
This is for me.
The big one!
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Yes, ma'am!
Yes!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
He has a computer?
All right.
The guy with the underpants!
Yeah.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Not that one!
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Really?
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Hi, Eve!
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
No.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Is that a birthday cake?!
Yes, it is.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Like one of Mom's?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
That's what everybody believes?
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
Who use to own it?
When did we get it from them?
I don't think so.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
I'm not wearing his pants.
The recovery is very impressive.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up there!!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Whatcha looking at?
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Well, where are you --
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
You got a light, honey?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Let's eat our cake.
Yes...
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
Stop it, you two!
Always good advice.
Where are you going?
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
He left with Sophie.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Oh, no!
Give it back to him.
What's wrong?
Have him committed.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
To get some frozen poultry.
What?!
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Are you Detective Williams?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
What color is it?
Is Sandy part of this?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
No.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Sometimes I think I do.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Where are we going, Frank?
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Can I use the car tonight?
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I know.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Am I bothering you?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Brilliant.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Yes.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
You worry about me really?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Probably not. No. Why?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Look Jeffrey.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Anybody you think is evil?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
You think they sold me out? No way.
Look again for fuck sake!
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
You guys?
Mother, is that you?
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
Yeah?
So, what do we do now?
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
How do you figure?
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
New hitman wants to leave his mark
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Worst day of my life, man.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
What the fuck do you mean?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Yes.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
OK. That's wrong.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Yeah, I heard that.
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
I keep it for emergencies.
See if mine are in there.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
I'll just say it.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
See, now we've got a plan.
This was in fourth grade.
Where was it parked?
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
Shh.
I think we better go home.
I'm not. But there's --
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What do you think?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Any activity?
Help me move him.
I'll see you there.
Like amnesia.
You got to be kidding me.
You're living on a sailboat?
Nice to meet you.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Yes, he did.
Exactly. Woah.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
I hope not.
Anthony, I --
What?
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Sixty days?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
What are you doing?
Cuba.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
It's true, Dignan.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
His name was Swifty?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
Is he chasing us?
What the fuck possessed you?
Bob. Are you coming?
That could be anybody's.
How long has he been in there?
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
I know it's not.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Wait a second --
26 weeks.
And what does that cover?
Well, I think --
Where did he go?
What's the story?
We're closed, sir.
You a good pool player.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
...this is Conklin's computer.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Yes...
I can't let you do that either.
Conklin.
Try again.
Who sent you to Greece?
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
I worry when you get like this.
Sleep. Sleep now.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
You drive.
Who is Pamela Landy?
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Oh, shit...
You didn't answer my question.
-- go -- take the van! --
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Some women like Dobermans --
What do you think? Is he coming in?
So?
Yes. In that order.
Longshanks promised!
Wallace has sacked York!
No, M'lord.
I don't want to be a martyr.
They're coming!
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
How do you know this?
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
We can't stop!
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
I deserve a lot worse.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Of course.
What do you want to know, Evan?
It was a long time ago.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
So it didn't feel... weird?
Are you okay?
I walk differently?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
There's one major hole in your story.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
We'll find out soon enough.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Come on, go on...
It didn't feel like a dream.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Just get out, didja?
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Yes, I'll bet.
Yes, Monsieur.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Goodnight.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Yes, I come.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
What do you want for Sam?
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Do you know where they are?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
No, not yet.
But Richard, no, I, I --
And I said I would never leave you.
It's been a long time.
Where is Rick?
Goodnight.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes?
Did he give any reason?
-- Yes?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
How do you do?
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Had a close one, eh?
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
My bill.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Good evening, gentlemen.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Mademoiselle.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
But everybody's having such a good time.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
It was a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Yeah? What's his name?
Oh, but I just told you. --
He is traveling with a lady.
I have my orders.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
What friend?
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Hello?
Get me the Radio Tower!
For how long?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
You ever going to bed?
No.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Take it, damn it.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Nothing out there but ocean.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
He is a cute thing.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
That's your dog.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
What's that, written on the sail?
You okay?
I most definitely say I am.
What happened to your pants?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Kamal is not here.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
You were how long on this?
What?
That's what it's about.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
What, then?
San Francisco.  And you?
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You weren't dreaming about me.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What are you going to tell the little ones?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Uh... it's the end of October.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Migrants?
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
So. What should I do now?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
Where'd she get you?
Yes, for both.
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
It's just my heart.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Just the last three weeks.
Grifters...
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
I was doing it for them.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Mob?
So what? We hide, right?
I told you, use less powder.
How much we going after?
Jake --
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Minus one.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I think two million.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
What -- What do we do?
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
You get an equal cut.
What about Customs?
And some new clothes.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Look at you... You want to go.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
He was looking out for you.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
Jesus... Take it easy.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
Sorry. I didn't know...
What do you want? An apology?
Stop waving that thing around.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Aces, Suits.
In over your head?
Can I speak to you in confidence?
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
You sell it.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I want a job, Giles.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
I get it.
Not particularly.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
You're my prisoner.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
What's the time?
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
Why not?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
It's beautiful. Thank you.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Leave me alone, Marion.
It's not that.
I've lived there.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
How did you hurt your hand?
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
I didn't.
I owe a lot of money.
Yes.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Jani! Where are you?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Ross.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Does Bella come here?
I'd like to buy you a drink.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Where's the magnet?
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
How?
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
You can start Monday week.
I just want the job.
Thanks for the information.
Key? Key? What is the key?
The key!
It didn't go off.
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Huh?
This is fun.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Mafhkin oble groop...
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Veil nebula.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sir?
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
You mean until you showed up?
But I'm afraid of--
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
You're light a deuce.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
I know.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
I won't be staying.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
You got a lotta nerve.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
I already don't like the sound of this.
I'm sorry.
We're quoting Mom again.
But she does work here?
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
What do you want?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
I think you should go now.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
A little what?
How long you and me known each other?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Where?
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
--a philandering pig.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
I'll give it my best shot.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
She was the one--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
Okay, okay, okay--
More like deployed in bed asleep.
For a change.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
What the hell is that?
Hawk.
Got any KISS?
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Damn straight we are.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
No... You don't think...?
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Jam, listen up.
Hawk?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Cool.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
It was stolen!
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Mom, what're we...?
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
What do you want?
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Hi... what's going on here?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
So... that's it?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
I didn't say shit.
You'll know soon enough.
You have to do something for me first.
Why is that?
I'm sorry.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
And what?
They suspended me for two days.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
Did you call the cops?
Why? Is this about the book?
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
People aren't that simple.
You're such a fuck-ass.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Why should we care?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
His name is Frank.
Frank.
What is her name?
What else do you think about during school?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Can anyone else see him?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Is Callie still around?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
I know.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
What did you want for Christmas that year?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
When will this happen?
Thank you.
What's her name?
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Chut up!
You're what?!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Yeah...
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
Okay?
That bitch from...
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
"My"...
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
"My dear President"...
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Was it -- swine?
Your Excellency!
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
They have noble faces.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
John loves the house.
Hmmm?
I found it.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
What happened?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Yes sir.
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
You've never been?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Oh no?
Oh no, my friend...
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
Yes!
Mmmerrick.
Yes.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Your mother?
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Won't come out, eh?
No, he's very upset about something.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Yes. John wants it.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
WELCOME?
But you LOVED her all the same...
We mustn't let him land!
I... but I...
Yes -- I believe you do.
There is something I must ask the Gods...
I shouldn't have come.
How?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
What about the raping?
About raping me?
You DON'T like it, do you?
Aaagh! Rape!
I didn't mean to!
Why should you care?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
Halfdan the Black's here!
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
What's it all about?
So?
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
That's better.
A magic dishcloth.
I think we should go...
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Hy-Brasil?
What do we have to do?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Who's that?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Can't make enough swords!
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's a tradition.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
No, Mother.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
How are you today?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I'm sure you would.
I don't know what that means.
Yeah.
What?
Um --
You pick it.
Well, I should probably get going.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Yeah, I guess.
Thanks.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
No.
That's scary sounding.
Okay.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Joel!
This is our first "date" date.
What was I wearing?
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Yeah, like that.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I guess so.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I don't know. Panties and --
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Yeah. Cool.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Very cool. Trippy.
What?
You better go.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
And after that?
Mary...
Is that Nietzsche?
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Mary. What are you doing here?
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Time to play Spam in the can.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
What happened?
What's wrong?
His peritoneum has ruptured...
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
What's on your mind?
What, Justin, what shows you?
How do you know all this?
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Patch me through to him.
Justin.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
I'm not the Devil.
Heading three-three-four...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
It is now.  We're locked in.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
Captain Miller, you copy?
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Maybe one of the original crew?
Who?
You've got to listen...
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Weir can't be alive.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Keep him talking.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
A straight line.
Do they have pressure?
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Those yours too?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
What are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.
What do you want, Vic?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Five times.
I had it at four.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Reed?... Sue?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Hey! That's a prototype!
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
And where do we think we're going?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Front page?
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
For science.
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
I can... make it work.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Please don't make this personal --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
No. I want my money back right now.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Do you have any ice tea?
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
You're a really good kisser.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
It's definitely your mama.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Well, I've gotta be running.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Are you Linda Barrett?
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Are you going to ride that wave?
I thought he was out of town.
All right.
My brother's car!
So what did you do?
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Well I never did it.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
It couldn't be.
I paid for it and everything.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
What can I get for you tonight.
How about the point?
That's a nice shirt.
It's very warm out tonight.
Are you really nineteen?
Do you know what you want?
I had a really nice time tonight.
Where's Mike today?
What's April 16th?
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Dobermans don't talk.
A major!
Where ya comin' from, young man?
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
...and we're chock full of that!
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Yes!
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
We should go! We should go right now!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Yeah.
I don't think you should...
We shot a skunk.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Ohhh.
Just an observation.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your parents of relation?
How are you holding up?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
How much you got?
Fully.
Nine?
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
Let's move.
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Are you lying to me?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Excuse me, sir?
Oh. I mean, good.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
You're afraid!
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
Frances.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
You don't think I'm good enough?
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
In my eyes, officer.
GET OUT!
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I know.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Please, Francie...
You're poisoning that child's mind.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Address?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
They'll mend.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
What?
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
Is that why you did it?
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Think I'll have a glass.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Evening, gorgeous.
What a man!
To quarter-horses.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
What's that?
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
That would be okay.
Pretty morning.
And no people.
...Is that not true?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
I'm not!
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
I don't believe so.
And what's that?
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
You drove him to his torment.
What kindness?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
You're an outcast.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
She's not for you.
Nothing. Still nothing.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
God took her from us.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Brother and sister still?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
Henry Clerval.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
For what?
Are you a physician?
Who are you?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
Trouble?
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I had to.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
Ow!
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
What was that?
You said it was just you and your son.
What are you gonna do?
You don't believe in suicide.
Jacob.
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
He's my son.
You're a preacher?
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
That happens, you'll get it back.
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
Mexico.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
Start the car.
You believe me don't cha?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Do they have a waterbed?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Keep your voice down.
This ain't the time.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
He needs our help!
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
None at this time, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Oh, really.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Pardon?
I'm saying, we're just friends.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Yes, dear.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
Time.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
She's haze grey and underway...
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Me?  Why me?
No shortage of suspects.
I don't know, I don't care.
What?
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
That's a good story.
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Do you, uh, know...
'Cool?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Should I be afraid?
I think you're the liar.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
We're fucked.
Thought you two were file-closed.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
I got pretty close.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
What's it to you?
So have dinner with me tonight.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
We've met before.
Why do you need that?
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Go ahead!
What?  What?
Nothing.
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Yes. Good was done this .....
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
What's  your name, son?
Brandon.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
But you don't?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
... What does that mean?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
Hi everybody.
They're gone.
We're alive!
~e're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
It's Jason...
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
You're kidding. When for?
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
I... certainly, but-
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Could be this.
What kind of signal?
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Find them.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Well, what have you thought?
Yes, my lord.
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
To hell with Arnold...
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Lafayette is a child!
Partially...
Unofficially, General Greene.
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
What is it, Marquis?
My God, what?
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
George, you know I only love you, but...
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
Then why are you teaching me...?
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
My daughter, I ask only...
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
I reserved a Cadillac.
So where's the money?
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Your who?
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Karen? You okay?
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
Depends. Who's this?
Hello? You there?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
I'm looking at you.
Maybe a few times I have.
He drown?
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
What?
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
One we're producing.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
How about this?
Compass.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
They report it to the IRS.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
How? By taking my money?
It's all mine.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Man, can you scream.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Depends, who pays?
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
You okay?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
I'm thinking about producing.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Hm?
You seem to feel fine about it.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
Harry -–
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Let's not be too hasty.
Where from?
Maureen.
Roger?
Last thing we want is extra partners.
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
How much longer's that gonna take?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long, then?
Goddamit, Dodge.
Went aboard.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
What?!
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Go on.
The guy. He just came this way.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
Greer?
But where's the damage?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
We hit land.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
Yeah.
Morning.
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
I heard that.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
How're you feeling?
What happened?
You've been out for about a day.
Oh, man.
We're still drifting.
Can't find the shotgun.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Fifteen, at the most.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
But I can't --
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I didn't check my messages...
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Hi Josh.
Why?
When did I say I hated you?
Oh, hi...
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
How perfect.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Or maybe not.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Hi, Al!
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Look at how cute I am!
Look, that's back when I hated you.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Oh yeah...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
Ew ... when did you get that?
Give me all your money, bitch!
Where did you get that?
Anthony's II!
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
No, really...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Hello?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
It's fine.
What about me? Am I not even here?
Well, we won't keep you.
Who does?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Is this one any good?
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
NO!!!
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, right...
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
It's not hopeless...
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
What, like a girdle?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Oh, hi...
Boo!
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.
...What do you mean?
I had to see you.
What about Joe?
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
I dunno, I...
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah.
Talk to us about it...
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Thank you, doctor.
Let me see the sick.
There is no reason for fear.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
I do need to see Starling.
Starling?
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Very good indeed.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Finish your tour?
...one shot...
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Have you got it?
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Think about something else.
But of course yours worked.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Oh yes, I think so. 
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I'm not even good for me.
Is this the spot?
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
These boys aren't playing around.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
Like what?
Egon!
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
What's that?
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Like a goat on garbage.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
I'm ready.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
And pure --
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Now where are you going?
... I thought it was the drug store.
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
Well, let's check it out.
I told you, I ...
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
I'm always serious.
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Don't cross the beams.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Who?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Anything!  Just make contact.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
No sense worrying about it now.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Where are you, Pete?
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
And the seas would boil ...
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
I am their hero!
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
You're hearing about somebody else.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Would that Marcus had lived.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
You brought the army into Rome.
They're studying with Cynics.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
Do you want some dinner?
Where is the car?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No, I couldn't.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Benjamin --
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What is it?
GET OUT!
I want to ask you a question.
I don't understand --
No.
Tomorrow?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Oh no. He said that.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
What?
You heard me. Out of here.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Benjamin?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
What for?
But it's light in there now.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Like what?
So?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
I know that. But I'm --
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Jesus Christ!
May I sit down?
He didn't see me.
Do you want to get it now?
Well -- I don't know.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
What?
Well.
Either one will be fine.
Who said it was my first time?
If you want.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Can I take off my clothes now?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
Him?
Thank you.
About five years.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Don't tell Elaine.
What?
Not particularly.
And you were a student also.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
Don't talk about Elaine.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Do you understand that?
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Benjamin?
I wouldn't know.
You wouldn't.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
What have you done to her?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
I guess -- about my future.
No.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
That has nothing to do with it --
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Quite a while.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
I'd like to hear it.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Why?
Can you see me now?
Dad -- can you listen --
Well?
Need any help?
How?
How?
Have you seen it?
Oh!
Chasing what?
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Going?
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
What can you see?
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
There.
So --
Do you understand?
I'll go -- good-bye.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Thank you, sir.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
For me?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Later?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Hello!
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Tomorrow morning.
I understand perfectly.
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
Come here. 
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Yes --
What?
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Take them back, Suzette.
Hurry, Suzette.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Yes, I know them --
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
That.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
My son was in the hospital --
Motherhood.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Right in front of the room.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Kaggs. Home office.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
So what's your story today?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
I know you do, so that's why --
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Uh-huh.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
This time...
Where's the five?
Oh, don't be stupid.
Get well soon.
Big spender.
I'm a salesman.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
You watch that mouth.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Gun?
What?
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Do you know who did this?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
My office?
Forget it.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Nothing.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Can I come in?
Then you come out here.
It's always John.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
What are you looking at?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Look, they're staring right at us.
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
He do that to you?
Why?  You interested?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
My, God!  What have you done to him?
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Halloween.
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Jamie's baby ...
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Samhain.
Yes?
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't tell you everything.
Go home.
You know what gets me?
The educational process.
Huh.
Everybody thinks that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
Hello.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
You're making a joke.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Anybody home?
Ask it!
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
College?
It makes life spicy.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
"The sting."
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Uck.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
I can't take my eyes off you.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Will you go to bed?
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Gee whiz, Dad--
I'm talking to you gently now.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Not at all.
Give us time.
Disease?
Situation.
What's that all about?
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
What a honeymoon.
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
Fish can't feel.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Did you like it, dear?
Two hundred years old.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Sounds quite beautiful.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
You've killed women?
Ooops.
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Oh dear.
She's fine.  Please--
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
With spittle?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
I see.
Was I ever of use?
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Get up.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
I'm only ten years old.
That is sad.
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
A what kind of doctor?
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
I didn't know that.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Who have you been talking to?
Is Norbert still here?
What?
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
Please--
He'd assume we had.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
Is he all right?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
Possibly.
Marry me instead.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
This is very good for us.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
Kid--kid--
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
Do you want to take a session?
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Pull out your cock.
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Tod might know.
I thought you were going to bed?
Huh?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
You know what I'm talking about.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
'Sucking off.'
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
No.
But it's all you do.
Not very.
Tijuana.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Fuck.
I can stop if you want.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
More or less.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
So then, Mr. Mast...
I've got a meeting...
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
I don't know.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Wes, do me a favor.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where!
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
You're talking about real excitement?
Rucker.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
To his own daughter?
The guy who bought you that ring.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Took it?
Lady, let me get this straight.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Where are the papers?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
I don't know.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Sort of.
All right.
Eh, fine.
Certainly a new experience for me.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
It is kind of rough.
But I don't play anything.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I don't know.
Yes.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
What was that?
With God?
Where's that?
But they have.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
A rough estimate.
Yes. It does.
Yes.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
To pit your own life against another.
That's right.
Parasite!
Stay where you are, Harold .
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Julia.
She's done it.
God, that's terrible.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
Are you crazy?
O.K. Let's go.
What are you talking...
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
I thought Steve had talked to you?
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Who?
Story of my life.
You were burned by some organic acid.
hound of resurrection --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
It's almost over!!
Do you believe in hell?
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Don't look! Turn around.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Well, you did break out --
We're on the move.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
Myers??? How's your arm?
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Myers?
What took you so long?
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Are you sure about this?
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Cocky.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
What's the problem?
I don't remember.
No.
This isn't happening.
Oh my God.
Frank --
There is going to BE a wedding?
Julia.
Help me.
What happened to you?
You're hurting.
What kind of doors?
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Who did?
You would be. They tore me apart.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
So where's the harm?
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Don't you care?
Kirsty.
Which is where?
What's the problem?
How long since you were here?
All right.
No argument.
He's here?
I'll be scarred for life.
Please.
You know it's not often I... you know...
This isn't the bedroom.
Who brought me in here?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
Big house.
Surprise.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
He's gone.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Get the fuck out of here.
I won't be able to stand.
It's late.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
If I make it through the day.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
What are you doing?
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Say it.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
You're not even coming?
What's up?
Because it's in The Big Chill.
No way.
I have a television.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
He's got one!
Anna Moss.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Nice friend.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
You look upset.
What needs sorting out?
I dunno.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I thought I could give you a lift back.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Fine.  One.
Of course it is.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
It's me.
Are you alright?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Look, we can do other things.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
You're being stupid.
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
WHAT?
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
You called this morning?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Don't you like that?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
Hi, Mom.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
Well call her mother.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
Sixty.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Records are those big round black things, right?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
No.
You've been listening to rumors.
What's all that?
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
You're using your son's name.
He knows about you.
That's insane.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
Come here, Brenna.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
Get out.
The inheritance.
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Forget it.
You and I should talk first.
Four?
Spare me the details.
What are you getting at, Moran?
What's all of this got to do with me?
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
You are the same?
Does it change with me in the room?
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
This is madness!
But we cannot be killed.
Why?
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
That is not me.
But I did live.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Something pretty.
Stay out of it.
Don't threaten me, Private.
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Where!
And the Bulgarian?
Kahn?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
What's the point?
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
What were _you_ looking for?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Seventy-five.
The five hundred? Sure.
I lost my wallet.
Yes, wasn't it?
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!

Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Call Duffy!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Just what I said. That's what I --
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
He's in the insurance business.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Say, could I meet him?
Afraid? I should say not!
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
No!
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Well -- what is it?
Then why are you doing it?
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You got plenty of money?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Pete, you're through!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
And so do I!
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
You'll take fifty and like it!
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
That's good.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Huh?
The what?
But how do I know...?
Here's the picture of my wife.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
What's that?
That was a googly!
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
What's that?
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Bugger off.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
Would.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
It's easy. I've done it.
Can't we just see the end?
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
What about it?
Why not?
Naturally.
Has Sue got it right?
What's that?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
You might still have a house.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Yikes.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Where's that?
Is your brother ready to go?
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Now, what makes you think that?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
But suppose for a second you did.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
How awesome?
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
She looks like she stinks.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Thanks.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Go around him.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
What are you doing!
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
Why?
Thank you.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Jesus Christ.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Just back up.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Sorry.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Hey.
We gotta break it open.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Like father, like son.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
French?
You decide. Today is your day.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Not at all.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Please. Just one minute of your time.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
It's okay, Puff.
Nice night.
He's dead.
That's what I'm counting on.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Loves animals. Loves you.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
How's it going?
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
My God! The fork! The fork!
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
What SPF, sweetie?
Flares?
A deer?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
So, how's it going today?
I'm just preoccupied.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Have you?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Oh boy!
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Puff, put the gun down.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Yes?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
You want a chaser?
I'm ready.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
Are you ready for another?
Cash.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Okay?
I'm buyin'.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
What's that supposed to mean?
Seventy-five per cent.
For me.
I never saw you do anything else.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
What's the matter? What happened?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Please don't get off me now.
Maybe. You want to play?
Yeah, that's right.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
In the gut, I mean.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
With what?
Is that what you think?
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Try me.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I'm not.
So why go to college?
Oh, cut my finger.
Haven't you opened it?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
What do you want to tell me?
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Hundred dollars?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
That's what the game's all about.
Do you still want me to stay?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Yes.
You and that damned garden.
You built things.
If we want it, it is.
Are you all right, Dad?
It was so real, Dad.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
Do you know how to follow a map?
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
What is it?
Don't go in.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Why, yes.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
What?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Not really...
I'm thinking.
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Any news on my wife?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
Yes, I am.
You're late.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Can they be killed?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Dad was onto something here!
How's the head?
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Are you expected?
I'm through!
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
It must be one of these...
No?
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Well, uh...
No! Don't Shoot!
Umh?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
What am I looking for?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
What about Marcus?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Those people are trying to kill us!
This is intolerable!
Now, who are all these people?
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
That was seven hundred years ago.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Who are you?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Just a routine inspection tour.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
You understand what he tells us?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
What'd he say?
Can you move your arm?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Any more complaints?
Not leftovers?
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
What?
My name is AL.
Who was it?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
What for?
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Yeah.
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Now what?
I wouldn't say that.
I want out.
I don't know...To get Al.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
I did. I brought you back here.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Go out, take your first left.
What am I supposed to do?
What about it?
The beach.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Eat it.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Where are you going?
I made it work.
What is it?
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Not her. You!
You got any books in there?
Don't you think I stand out like this.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
...drink it.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
You sure this will work?
What was it? What'd I say?
Are you alright?
Do something.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
About what?
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
What part what?
What kind of a deal?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
We'll have to let them go.
It's just money.
...Foreign service.
Don't you want to get out?
I feel fine.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
And you.
What's so funny?
That you're not crazy.
And how'm I doing?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Who else is interested in me?
What did you tell them?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
Who did?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
Food doesn't agree with me.
Why?
This business is over.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
What?
You've  been there?
I knew it. I told him.
He wants to apologise.
Yeah...I have to get away.
Why'd you invite me here?
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Why not?
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
Yes.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Hi, honey.
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Monday.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Yeah, I heard rumors.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
I'm not touching my film...
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
That computer has everything...
Okay. 
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Alright.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Did I get you up?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Coffee?
Yeah... Thank you.
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
I know what I have to know.
How much would I get paid?
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
...okay.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
What did you get us?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
You charge by the hour?
Why?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
You believe that?
No.
You believe that?
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Well, I wouldn't say --
They hate each other --
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Baby. You are so HOT!
You did good, Massey!
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I don't need it.
It was a gift from a client.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
Got any symptoms?
He's the wrong man.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
What is your husband's profession?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
What does your lawyer think?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Thank you.
Hmmm...
She didn't love you?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Friends?
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Did you just propose to me?
I know.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
But?
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Hello Marylin.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
That's blackmail.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
We are. And it's winding down.
He never even asked. He just assumed --
You're not...
Yes?
Ha Ha.
I'm not sure.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Nothing.
No. You're not.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
She owes me a meal.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Hi, Sweetie.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Three is not Farrow.
Yes, sir?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Mr. Warne?
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
What's this about not eating?
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
I knocked several times.
Stunt?
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Oh, come now—
I don't know.
Why? Do you know him? 
I suppose so.
Why should she? After all—
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
What happened to your money?
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
No.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
I beg your pardon!
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
What are you talking about?
You must have me confused with—
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
You weren't so bad yourself.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
To New York?
No.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Peter—
Oh, Peter— 
know—but—
was—but—
Sure.
What are you thinking about?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
Eat a carrot.
That's swell!
I hope you got your money.
Not interested. 
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
Eight o'clock tonight.
Isn't he here?
Mr. Gordon—
Huh?
Yes.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
What do you reckon that's for?
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
Thanks. 
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
You love them, don't you?
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
No.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
No, I did not.
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
I want the truth.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Was he there often?
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
Germany.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Yes?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Six.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I know. That's why I went.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Three years.
What'd ya mean?
What's the problem?
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
And you didn't tell the Police?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Help yourself.
Take your time.
Help us do what?
You don't want much, do you?
How was your flight?
I thought you might want a drink?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Why does it need to be dark?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Want to hear some music?
Who is this?
He came by.
You're not old. You look great.
What'd ya see?
How was it?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
You talk them into it?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
When did you decide?
The feds. It's evidence.
Do you think they bought it?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Ray wants him.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Oh, Miss Brown?
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
Not really.
You didn't count it?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
What about me?
I'm waiting for the phone.
They asked.
Baby, I didn't --
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
Who?
That's the idea.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
She don't know shit about the money.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Where at?
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Is it dead?
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
I'm going to wait in the car.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
I'm in my underwear.
She believed you?
Pretty sure.
What?
Came outta where?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Maybe the Feds got it.
You gonna tell me who it was?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Watcha gonna see?
He's a big one. You two tight?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Did the police contact you?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Where is it?
How'd you find me?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
You expect me to just walk in there?
Yeah.
You sure?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
He's around.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
Then what are you doing here?
What do you want?
Are you all right?
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Hey, wait!
Wait ... Daddy.
Don't go.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Used you?
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Not me, buddy.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She talk about the boys?
I thought you said she didn't say much.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Hell, you think I am?
Carlson? Is he new here?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Jake, is that you?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
I moved the couch. That's all.
What happened to you?
I don't know.
Who? Jed?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
I don't let anybody call me that.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
They're like demons, Jez.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Lie down!
Help me! Help me!
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
He did? When?
It's just me.
Jezzie?
Are you out of your mind?
I can waitress. I'm good.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Why won't you answer me?
You look upset.
Then don't bug me.
Don't be funny.
WHO ARE YOU?
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
Hot. Where do I sign?
You got a nice tan, though.
He's burning up.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Total delirium.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
Speaking.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
You can't talk in Brownsville?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
Do you want me to get someone?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
What are you doing?!!
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
You see that?
The hull's imploding!
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Fuckin A...
Kicker, anything?
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Rizzo, he's out there.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You wanna release your air tanks?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
I'll help you in.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
What?!!
Jason? He's on this ship?!
They can deal with this sort of thing.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Yes!
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
You got it.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
Got a pen on you?
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Just keep kicking.
I didn't know her.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Look at him take it!
You love sharks?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Over there!
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
So, what do you think we should do?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Okay, cool.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Um, hi?
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Wizard!
Did you hear it's yours?
What? I'm not made of stone.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
You don't know anything about me!
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
We definitely want it to have junk.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Your name, please?
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Yeah, she does.
I sort of already have.
Or...
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Is this Juno?
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
No.
You lose!
Is it hard to learn?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Hold still.
...Anything else?
What the hell is this stuff?
...thank you.
Vernon, Florida.
Tight fit.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
This the book your writing?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Sure.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
You two been busy in here.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Thanks. What are you doing?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
All set?
Carrie... stop it.
What are you going to do?
Not yet.
Where's Adele?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
You were plenty hot.
Who are you?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
What do you think?
She can fuck?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Yeah.
Are you hungry?
Why?
It is right.
It's no big deal, right?
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
You got any money?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Na.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Sup then? Sup?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
At the block party?
She won't? Why not?
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I don't want you to hurt me.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Why?
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Come dance.
I tested positive?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Passion...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yeah.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Mom.
Shh.
Where does everyone sleep?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
What?
No, I need the original note.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Yes you are.
Local?
You think he's dirty?
You still having a problem with this?
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
We'll find the evidence.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
You're not going to tell me that.
But you said you didn't know her.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
I know where you are.
Very good.  How did you know?
What's this?
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
No problem.  We're in.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
That has nothing to do with it.
How long has she been dead?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
What about prints?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
That's great.
Same as the others?
Yeah.
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
Through a rental agency.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Answer the question.
You have something you want to say?
Just thought you might want to talk.
Feel like practicing?
Is this your first time here?
Uh huh.
When I was very young.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
You sound like my mother.
Another kind of game?
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
Do you?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
No.
I thought you said the line was busy?
What?
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
You beat him.
Me too.
<u>What</u>?
Have they harmed you?
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Where is the Fortress?
Take the western passage.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
I cannot betray my bride.
You will not, then?
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
My <u>friend</u>.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Go, join them.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
Quell?
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
Look at its insides.
He didn't join them. They joined him.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
With an old voice?
You know the voice.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Kegan!
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
It is no trickery.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Knowledge.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
No, no.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
May I go to the cinema?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
A little...
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
Yes?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Don't fear.
You can't sit here like that.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
But... He works for your same employer?
No...
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
What if you don't make it?
Are you two planning kids?
What would you like us to do?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
Show me.
You like to take walks?
You've just decided, is that right?
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Your father?
Go to sleep Ellen.
From where?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Is that right?
Perhaps there's another route?
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
Mammoth.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
When are you leaving?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
What do your friends call you?
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
What do you mean?
Evening News?
This isn't right.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Don't run away.
What's up?
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Why?
I know that...
How are you doing?
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I don't understand any of that.
Thank you, Sera.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Let's stay for a while.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
I've been all right.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Why would I kill my husband?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
Come again?
Did you get it?
What are you talking about?
So everything you just said --
You're not going up there.
Was she carrying a weapon?
What's going on?
What?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
God, that felt great!
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
You almost had me fooled.
I'm a bitch.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Neat.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
I got bangs!
Neither.
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Your what?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
I completely agree.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Pink ones.
Hovering?
Why so few?
My generosity is not so large as that.
Your love.
You're magnificent.
Not from me, surely...
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
You're a beast!
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
And if I cannot?
It's bluebells!
What!
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
What do I do?
The princess is dead.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
Aye!  That too.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Beware.
This is ogre's magic.
Worse than the battlefield.
What know you of fields of war?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
We'll find it.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
It doesn't matter.
Go on... go on...
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
You see!  You see!
Aye... my Lord...
Dolt!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
What shall we do?
Oh, dear.
I'll go search for it.
Shhh!
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
They tricked you.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Tis the truth.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Not very precise directions.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
What do we do now?
Praise be to God.
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Uhm... fine work.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Simple as that, eh?
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
What color?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
Hey.
I don't want you to!
Does everything have to have a point?
What are you talking about?
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
You hate your father.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
He won't leave my room.
This is such a street of whiners.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
A violation?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
What are you on?
I'm not.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
I did warn you.
I'm not going!
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
I'll hate you forever.
I warned you yesterday.
I hate turkey.
It bugs me.
You'll have money when you work.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
What I'm not.
That's not true.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I loved him too much.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
Four days.  I left to think.
I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
I drove over and you were gone.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Should I?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
You don't look like you.
What are you doing in my room?
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Not for me, it ain't.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Can't you remember your own name?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Alright. You want some pie?
So you made a generous contribution.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
Yeah.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
I said you're soft.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
You get ketchup?
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
It's a pardon from the governor.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
That was five years ago.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Back to New York for starters.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Yeah? You and what army?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
How about some steak sauce?
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
Where am I at, man?
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Blacks welcome there?
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
Makin' friends already.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Now everybody sit down.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
How bad?
Bus?
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
Hey...
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Hello.
You smell like coconuts.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
You have a dog? What kind?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Yes...
It looks like the work of a brother...
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
What other food?
Just the face.
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Anybody we know?
I'm fine...  See you...
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Yes... probably he was renewed?
And now?
What Quad do you live in?
You know.
I don't have much time.
Uh-uh.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
I -- I can't.
They won't listen.
Will you take me with you?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Don't!
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
...But I still have the choice...?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Beloved husband...
Hello, Sandman.
Where are they?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
They're comin' with us.
Why not?
What is?
I was here yesterday.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I don't know.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Sure.
Are you positive he knows?
What's he do?
Pete... Don't...
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
What night is that?
Hey.
What's up?
The police called us.
Sheila?
Have you made any charges against him?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
You talk to him?
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
What about yesterday?
He's not Madison?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
What is it?
At your house. Don't you remember?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
That's why I married you.
What's that?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Good book, huh?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
We've got to call the police.
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Yeah.
What's goin' on?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
No... I told you.
I don't know.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Sheila...
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Yes.
Where are they? Do you see them?
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Charming chap.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
No.
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
And the wine - excellent.
Goodness, no!
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Splendid!
Are you taking me?
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Hurray!
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
What are you talking about?
Did I say "if"?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Uh-huh.
Porters?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
I don't need any proof.
Is that all my story meant to you?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Yes, everything!
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
What if he refuses?
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
How about you? Do you want to go?
Hesitated, sir.
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Cowan--
And if I say yes?
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
I wasn't scared...
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
I taught kindergarten.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
He's here to help!?
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
They're not my pals--
Found it.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
You don't remember me, do you?
They were performance pieces.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Don't worry, Lamar.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
We won't let them.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
John --
You're kidding, that's today?
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
Yeah?  So?
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Why did you catch that?
But you call this room the "temple".
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
You set me up...
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
I need help with her.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
I scored a goal!
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
You say some of the children died?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
If... you have one.
-- and then walk out.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Which one is that?
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
How did you get this?
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Can't they shut that off?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
I don't know, why?
What kind of cop were you before this?
Since right after we lost our son.
They've never been separated before.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
You sure? I just made it.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Women?
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
Bullshit.
It's daytime.
I feel weird asking him.
Goodbye, Bobby.
I said no touching.
Your dance is over.
Well, you look it. You win?
What's your record at?
So, when's the drop.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Brooklyn.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Where's Ricky?
How so?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Then what are you saying?
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
There won't be a next thing.
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
What's that?
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Any time, bro.
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I know the number.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
I'll get the girl.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Nothing.
How'd they know who you were?
Don't even start.
Motherfucker...
You fucking nuts?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
What the fuck was that about?
We're getting whacked.
Let's do it.
Did you hear what he just said?
All the more reason.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
It was six in the fucking morning.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
No. I'll wait here.
Kinda. Yeah.
Yes?
Where do you live?
Why? What I say bad?
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Yeah.
The Soho Grand?
Sure. You boys want anything?
Keys.
I get it.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
Yeah.
Scotland.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
Solid, daddy.
Daddy, where's my money?
I'm wearing, Archie.
Let Billie finish.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Who the hell are you?
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
I can't.
No, Brother Minister.
Next week, Brother Minister.
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
Let's talk about you for a change.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
Why do you ask?
Talk about what?
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Yes, sir, I did.
I say a lot of things.
Is she hooking?
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Let's go.
Your control over your children, therefore --
You're my father.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
You had the number.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
[Why?]
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
[Daniel.]
[The what?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Drive.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
Is it loaded?
How does it affect you?
And what if amateurs try it?
What do you mean, I'm here?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Did you like school, Creasy?
No.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Well, I let him go.
Well, it's a sort of wife.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
Your father has business.
Could I ask you a question?
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
I'm fine.
Sorry.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
For a year?
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[No. Why?]
Good news. You're going back to school.
He has to go, Samuel.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
It will be a hard break.
[Is that good or bad?]
That's what friends do.
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Which one was that?
Oh, yeah.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
Oh.
Well, it ain't your baby.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
I'm having a very good time, too.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
You say something?
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
You gonna get married.
You not ugly.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
Hey, Ang'...
You want a beer, Ang'?
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Well...
On accounta...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Okay.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
You – must – open – me – up – again?
We got to stop them right here.
He can't take much more time on the table.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Y'all just act natural.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
We're a good team.
Ravenous. What about you?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Is he out?
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
He only lasted one season.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
I think we could still have a chance.
See you.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
How did you get called that?
Of course not.
You're leaving tomorrow?
You're asking for somebody else?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Thanks.
What's the story?
He's coming to.
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Damn.
Nice.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Are you all right?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Against what?
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Me?
Did you write this?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
Oh.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Oh!
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Had any schooling?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
St-rike!
It must be some kind of a gag.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Four bits.
I trust him.
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
How?
How about family? Got any family?
No.
What's your name?
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
That's too bad.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Out the window! Something just flew by!
I didn't see anything.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Where's the stereo?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Automatic.
...a car.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
Open your shirt.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
Yeah.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Recruited you from where?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Do you really?
I think I can handle that one.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
You tell me.
I'm just practicing my lying.
The 6 horse is still last.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
McCall, you all right?
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
What do you want from me?
You got a bet on the game tonight?
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
I've been craving that stuff all week.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
How's Paco doing?
It's very nice.
Where's the damn wire?!
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Because I took it out of your memory.
Why --
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
What's happening?
No.
It's not real.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Unfinished business.
Who?
He had keys.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
What is it?
Who did he digitize?
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
What did he tell you?
Then you had her killed.
Why would I do that?
There was no need to kill her.
What brings you inside?
-- You told me.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
So how can we get to it?
That's pretty bad.
Release the power WITH the power.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
All systems go!
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Up here, Boss.
Are you frightened?
And now you have everything.
What do you mean?
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
But that's an hour's drive.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
What about the share.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
You disrespect our tradition.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Shuddup.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Forget it.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
That a Jew compliment?
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Back? You're sending me back?
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
You're really gonna pop the question?
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Who?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
The ring...
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Is there something else I can do for you?
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Aaron?
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Really?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
So, you come here all by yourself?
Moscow.
Where's the Majority Leader?
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Paine.
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
"There's more light here," he says--
My friends?
Shut up, Diz.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Yeah.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
We're gonna get married.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
He's a house-afire!
What!
All right, why?
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Henry Hill.
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Aw--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Yes. Come in.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
For a question!
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Will he yield for a question?
Will he *yield*?
Mr. President! A point of order!
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Just fine.
Office of--Senator Smith?
*No*!
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
No. What had you better--?
Calendar?
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Why?
It *is* not!
I've got more. You better tell me.
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
What do they--? Who are all those--?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Do you want to dictate them?
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Well--I--
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Well--me, too!
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Senator Paine will state it!
Order!
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Who's that?
Since he was born.
Are you married?
Thank you very much.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Yes.
Yes!
NO!!
What's that got to do with it?
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
I enjoy it.
Sure. I met you.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Oh, that—
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
No, I don't mind.
A girl?
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Hello, Mary?
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
People have been crucified before.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Yes.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
I wish you luck, sir.
I wanna see that guy!
Must we have the echo?
But your honor—
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
How do you do.
You're going to New York with us.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Have a drink?
Uh-huh.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Why, it's an artistic institution—
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Why not?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Binge?
Farmer?
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
You must have been concerned.
Mr. Cook.
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
What kind of doubts?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
What's that?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
Do you want to come in?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
...so rich?
He told you.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
I think you know what I mean.
Why don't you tell me?
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I'm not making any promises.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Where?
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Is that when you split up?
And he's where?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
I'm glad.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I think so.
Transference.
Will you think about it?
We're only talking about six weeks.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Weekly or monthly?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
What are you talking about?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
A doll?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
But look at me now...
How'd you do it?  The new you.
What about it?
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
And a birth certificate is enough?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Lily.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
None of the above, thank you.
My very good friend! What a surprise.
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
What does he want the book for?
Yeah?
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Where are they taking him?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
What are you doing here?
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
Every damn day.
The things that get you excited.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Preparation for what?
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
I'm not?
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
I'm staying.
You lied to me!
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
I knew you'd know.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
It must have slipped my mind.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
He was the last time I saw him.
Much less go outside.
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
Sounds good to me.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Have you considered my offer?
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
You're dead.
And the light goes out...
I'm not that kind of girl.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What have they got that we ain't got?
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
I'll drive.
There's a vague similarity.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
So you're chicken?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
But... only when no one is looking.
Are you famous?
This looks like a job for Superman --
Sorry.
The who?
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
Thank you.
Lisette La Croix.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
What are you doing in there?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Yes!!
Separate bedrooms?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
What the hell is the matter with you?
I couldn't face telling you.
My God, what do you think?
Do you like music?
Of course, my dear.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
What did you say his name was?
Come in.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Anything you need.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
No.  Thought he was with you.
Great moves, Day-Day.
Nobody!
Who is that?
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
What?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Damn, you got a stalker.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
Why?
You see that?
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
I did.  Is that door locked?
Delivery!
I don't play for no team.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
All damn.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
What kind of activity?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
What was that?
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
20 minutes?
Where did Craig move to?
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
What's the matter?
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
That's my girl.
Amtrack?
'S okay. What do you think?
My security people are right next door.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
You were very nervous.
No.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
The gun...
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
But...
I think you better put that away.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
What?
Who?
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Gimme a dollar.
You stole that.
Where are we going?
I'm not a baby.
I've got something for you.
It's under control.
Get moving.
That one.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Put her on.
No.
No, Ben.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
AAA-MENN!
You have all sinned!
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
Walt!
What's wrong, Mother?
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
John don't like him much.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Hm?
John, where are we g --
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Dead.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
I don't know nothin'!
I'll tell you a secret.
Sure, that's no secret.
Can I have milk too?
No.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What's wrong, John?
You'll whip me!
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
How can you tell?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Decide to take a day off after all?
He's dangerous.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
She lived there.
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
It wasn't that serious...
What?
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Feeling better?
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
From Leon.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
And you too, Ninotchka.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You want this?
Just for the honeymoon.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
Guest?
The Duchess...
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
No, sir.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Yes, Leon...
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
It's a real Paris reunion.
We don't want to be disturbed.
If you want to see us you must come later.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Comrade.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
You want me to go in there?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
What business?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Yes!
No visa.
You, please.
How long do we have to wait here?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
Suppress it.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
So that is your house?
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Is that customary?
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
I don't like your following me.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Just smile.
Why?
Then you should go back to your table.
You remember this room?
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
You must, darling.
Comrades! Comrades!
I must talk to my brothers!
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
No! No!
Let's turn on the radio.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Yes, Swana, you did.
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
Go on.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Yes.
May I ask why?
Cigarette?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
It's a code or something.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Mitchell?
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
Pay him.
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
But what are we paying him for?
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Just do what I say, Bob.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Mr. President!
What?
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Yes, Mother ...
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
And me? ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
What?
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Mein Kampf?
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
But it was all we had.
Syracuse.
Ernie Davis.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
What's in there?
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
I'll concede in the morning.
Dick, don't...
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
When?
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Won or lost?
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?
I'm... discouraged.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
None of that explains your man though.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Hard to believe.
He won't neither. He never has.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
It could be.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
What was the bullet?
No sir.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
...Be careful.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I put it in, Mama.
You gave your word?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
I need to know that.
Yeah.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Yes ma'am?
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Where does he work?
I can't say.
Mm-hm.
...You getting anything on this?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Well -- where ya goin'?
...I know where you are.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
Yessir.
What time do you close?
Now. We close now.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Yes.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
November the 28th, last year.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
How well do you know Chigurh.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Could I get another room.
...But that won't last.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
Could I have that in American?
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
Oww! My arm, careful!
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
"Banners?"
You must be joking.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Did you watch it yet?
Oh, Betty --
What?
I beg your pardon?
Yes, she is.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
I have... did it sound that bad?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I got you, Del...
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
I don't know.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
You're in serious danger!
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Worse.
She called you 'George,' George.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Who?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Looking for someone?
Were you with him this whole time?
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
I... I don't know...
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Should I kill him now?
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
What?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
It just didn't fit her profile...
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
I see.  May I?
Really?
Jesus Christ!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Waitaminute -
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
It ain't the law!
That's right!
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
How'd he know about the treasure?
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Yeah, look at me.
Pete have a brother?
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
That's not my ring.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
That don't make no sense!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
Pete... I do apologize.
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
I am. Hur you?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
...Yeah?
That's a maiden name.
Yes, sir.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Come back here, kid!
Okay, okay. You win.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
I wrote. Not every week...
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Yes, sir!
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
No. I never feel like that.
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Do you go to school?
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
What's the matter?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Jets.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
What?
Yes.
What?  What do you want me to do?
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
Get the fuck away from me.
NOT THAT ONE?!
They're not supposed to be here!
They won't get hurt.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Asshole.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Open it.
She's never coming out.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
You don't look so good.
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
Watch your mouth.
Makes me nervous.
He's going down.
What?!
What do they want?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Chills?
Fuck.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
We're never getting out of here.
Do it.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Stop it.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Man, fuck you!!!
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
You mean...
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
So what's the deal?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
I saw... but...
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
That would be nice.
What unit?
We did.
My pleasure, sir.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Sir?
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Are you going to meet with him?
How can we end this madness?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
You're in no condition to ride.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
Go on.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
It is ended.
Goodbye, Francis.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Seventeen.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Bite?
Honey, Church will be fine.
What's up, sugar?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
You believe in it.
I'm not tired!
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
God, that's fine.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
This was their burying ground, Louis.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Well, honey...you know that...
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
We got that part.  Anything else?
No, I really think I do.
That so?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
You have a name, missy?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
Move!
Somewhat.
Come aboard.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Are you certain this is the right way?
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
... No.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
And you still believe he's going to come here?
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
What did security say?
Well, you got another problem.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You're insane.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
Is something wrong?
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Just like old times.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
What did you want my hair for?
You made this out of my hair?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Argon's private lab.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
I remember I was trying to help...
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Indeed? How interesting.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
Certainly. Right over there.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Oh, Mother!
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Of course I am Stewart.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
What's the idea, Anne?
That's an excellent idea.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
How's that?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
I'll bite. What's the catch?
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Well - it's only April.
It has been alleged - yes—
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
No!
What are you doing fooling around in here?
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Hello, Stew.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Did who?
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Sorry, boss—
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Holy jumping swordfish!
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Heavens! The man's insane!
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
It's haunted just the same.
Well, sir, I putter.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
A bird in a gilded cage?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
What?
All night?
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
I told you, George. I'm not going.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
... Why?
What's the matter?
What'll it be?
Oh, no thanks ...
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
It was accessible to everyone.
I think I've got something to say.
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Get lost!
Noooooo!
I don't believe this.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Those are my friends.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
They don't have that kind of potential.
Me too. Sounds swell.
The pages filled in?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Keeps going ...
Oh ... Hi.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Rain.
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
Ooomph?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
Hello there.
I can't.
What do you mean?
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Bud ...
What's wrong?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Dream come true, hunh?
Oh GOD ...
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
So you can't talk to me?
This is "Fly With Us?"
Hello.
I feel really on the spot now.
Hey. What are you doing?
I'm in my bedroom.
Do you like porno movies?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
Really?
It doesn't matter.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Georgia.
Are you telling me no?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Not very well.
There's a piano in the street.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Yes? I'm trying.
Yeah.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Hello?
About six months ago. Why?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
...what...?
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Ok, bye, bye.
Please don't do this to me.
Yes it is.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your name?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
Can we agree that that is that?
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Mhm.
It's alright.
Yeah.
Hi, Lance.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
....now: this pudding?
Hi.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Nothing.
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't be late.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
So they'll go.
Are you sure?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
He's a writer, not a madman.
At your service, Count.
Yes, Abbe?
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
What? What've I done?
Free his mouth.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
What the devil --
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
A man after my own heart...
Don't confuse one organ with another --
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Go to hell!
Of course.
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
His wife's influence.
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
You're a sentimental man.
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
That's not our intent --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
There's something else I want from you.
Is it awfully violent?
Most assuredly.
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
They've taken your clothes?
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
You've come to lecture me?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
Randolph!
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
How so?
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Right-
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Fuck you
I expected more from you.
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
I'll hire you  -- right now-
How?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
They don't have to.
What?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
Hey, kid. Gregg.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Mank!
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Very generous
You're lying to me.
Get out
Pardon?
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
No, we're jake. But listen-
It was fun, wasn't it?
It was the best, kid
I'm Christ
Hey champ!
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
I'm Ok.
What who's been sayin'?
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
Where you going at this hour?
What's wrong?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
You heard me, I said hit me.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Whadda you care?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
With her? How?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
What time is it?
Can you see it?
You said never to touch you before a fight.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
No, I'm not.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
I got bored so I went to the movies.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
OK. Talk.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Open the door, Vickie.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Name me a better photographer.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Did you ever own a saw?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Jeff --
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Lisa Fremont.
That's abnormal.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
We've progressed emotionally in --
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
He and his wife splitting up?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
There's probably one in the basement.
Smart girl.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Who's Thorwald?
How's your leg?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
What a day I've had!
Tired?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
You mean "goodnight."
Now, Lisa --
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Yeah.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
What about it?
I don't know.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
It doesn't make sense to me.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
You know something?
How'd he get in?
No--
I think I should go home.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
And you dropped it?
We don't have time.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
No!
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
What's that pounding?
See?  It stopped.
Is he there?
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
What's your name!
Jim.  What's yours?
You scared?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
They're looking for you!--
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
No.  At dawn.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
I need it.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
He called me chicken.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Who lives?
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
You cold?
Neither can I.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
How did you know that?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
I was talking to Dad.
Why?
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel!
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
What.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Yes it was all you --
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
...the truck driver...
What the fuck is going on.
No, Nick, no --
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Gabriel!
I thought we'd have a few more days.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
Nick...
Don't say my name...
What?
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
I'm glad it was me.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
Where's she work?
What'd they call her in high school?
Be more specific.
What?
So what the hell good are you...
...never... tried...
What'd you tell that casino manager?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Where is he?! Where is he?!
I can't go back to Vegas...
What about the Powwow Safe?
Fuckin' freezing.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
What?
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Tell Ashley... I...
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Switch seats with me.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
I don't wanna lift crates.
Elois?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
What about?
The Brewers.
What?
I can do that.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Just hold on buddy boy.
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Mr. Blue's dead?
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
What's wrong with it?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
No shit?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
For all I know, you're the rat.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Look of things, she doesn't.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Our kind of women?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
We can't stay here!
Will she be dark or fair?
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
I can't --
What was he in jail for?
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Finished, son?
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You know what she asked me?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
Yes, people make me restless.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
You're not giving up?
We might as well start a fire.
We got company. Female company.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
I sure would.
What comes after Z?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
I found a picture of his wife.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
Hi Buddy.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Better try a little higher.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
It's the sequel.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Stop! --
Both of them?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
How are we going to get them all up there?
That one.
What the hell?!
I can do it myself.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
You do.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
She's right. We should stick together.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Father, I think you should rest.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
"Ray!"
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Mother? 
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Chip, honey?
But Mom, the video's not over.
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Detectives, what is this about?
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
You bring me such peace...
Oooohhhh.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
It's not fair!!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Marvin A. Pickles.
I do, please.
...Browsing.
Mrs... Sutphin?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
He's a good boy.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You think my sister is there?
I don't like this.
I'd like to get out of here.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What did she want?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
But you have treated me that way.
A job?
The people at the restaurant?
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Why wait?
And you knew he'd be here.
I don't think that's so revealing.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I don't know.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
And the other was Judd?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
I've lost my knack.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Perhaps.
Would they hurt her?
I was a great dancer...
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
I never thought you did.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Yes.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
That makes it all the more difficult ——
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
Yes.
Well...
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Nine years.
Sister older or younger?
I don't know.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Do you want them?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
My therapist said that --
You had sex with you therapist?
Videotapes.
Who's Donna?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
What about sex?
I'm sorry this came up.
She said it on her tape.
Why not?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
What do you have to do to get ready?
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
Yes.
I guess not.
Yes.
About who?
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
On tape?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
That's very flattering.
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
Yes.
Possibly.
Because.
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Who'd you have lunch with?
Are you having an affair?
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
When did you begin having this feeling?
No, I haven't.
What brought this on?
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Well, I wonder why.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Let me talk to him first.
Lose something?
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
I can't believe you did that!!
I feel like I do.
I don't want to discuss it.
Thank you.
Bye.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
There's a phone here.
How did you find me?
What do you get?
Talking.
That's all.
Would anybody else see the tape?
How long will it take?
Do I sit or stand?
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
What did he say?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I would.
I've got to get back to the office.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
You told Ann about this?
Hung up.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Student?
No.  You said three-fifty?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Really. How'd it go?
God, you need help.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
He said immediately.
He'll be really mad.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Another kiss?
Well? Supper at my place?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Yes? Who is there?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Didn't seem worried about them.
I don't get it.
Huh?
BREAKING OUT
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
Why Janet?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
Could you tell us a little about it?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
YOUNG BLOOD
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
F for...
F for...
THAT MINIMAL
This could be worse than the old series.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
And none of them worked?
Isn't she lovely?
We love you, Baby.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
What are you pouring tonight?
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Oh, that's tasty.
Oh yeah. Much better.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
She is very hot.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
Shut up.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Pull yourself together, man.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Count me out.
Later.
She's been leaving messages here too.
I will.  See ya!
Besides what?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
What do you think's going on?
Huh.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
You have to tell me --
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Do you like them?
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Yeah.
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
You said it looked like a car accident.
Well. That about does it.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
What are you drinking?
Twelve months in oak.
What was the bottle that did it?
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah, weird. But great.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
A paper?
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Hello?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Sir, what are you doing?
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
It makes me feel better.
A hair.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
Hi sweetie.
Does it hurt?
...I will.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
How can you say that?
They're distracting us?
We might lose the signal.
Dad.
They'll read our minds!
He definitely wasn't a midget.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
I think we lost 'em.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Sounds good.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
Where are we?
Where's the pinto going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Doesn't look quite fair.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
He is that.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
He is now.
Who is he?
Howdy.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
You're kidding.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Why are they doing this, Mal?
What about his brother?
I've given that up.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
It's the only place I'm happy.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
I wouldn't worry about that.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
I am telling the truth.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- It's called a projector.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Why isn't she with you?
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Hair and make-up?
Even the fall from the plane?
Excuse me?  Start?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
Simone?
You're with me to be close to her?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Hello, Hal.
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
You can't.
How did the wall get there?
-- Please, get away from me.
I was misquoted.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
Not like this --
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
You saw that?
Your mother couldn't make it?
Why?
I know plenty of boys.
Okay, Dad.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Really?  Too bad.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
No, that was me.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
I could get the death penalty.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
Is it a jamming device?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Taller, Viktor.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
--My God.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
What were they hiding from?
Dr. Crowe.
You use needles?
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
I don't tell her a thing.
Know what?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
That isn't magic.
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
Dr. Crowe?
Something happened, didn't it?
Where is she?
Like what?
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Alright!
Nope.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
I happen to be a professional.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
I could. You sucked.
Curt Cobain.
"And a slash-slash there --"
Sure. What do you want to know.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Suzie... No.
I almost thought for a second...
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Like what?
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
That's not funny.
Sorry.
No. What…?
Starla, it ain't --
No reception out here.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Yeah.
I got to leave my post.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Okay.
When one sees you they all see you.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Guess what?
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
Yeah.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I'm proud of you.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
What are you thinking?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Or in the slammer.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
You can't swear on these.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
We're gone.
We're outta motion lotion.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Oh.
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Maroon uniforms?
How bad?
And threw us into the lake.
And this is your car, isn't it?
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Really?
That's not possible. I told you.
I'm here, where's the car?
So I guess you're not going.
Your attitude sucks.
I can't discuss --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
...So you made another deal?
...So you knew all this and yet y--
You love her?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
What'd you say?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
Can it work?
She'll come back.
No, she won't.
He's dead.
I wish you'd told me.
What will you say?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
What are they?
You didn't look very happy.
Rheya.  Not here.
Is it intelligent?
What happened to us, exactly?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Neither did I.
I never said I didn't.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Are you nervous?
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
No dog.
But "nice".
What's to like?
Tell it like it is.
Stop being nuts!
I don't know you...
Oh God, that's great!
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
Long enough.
Say goodbye, Mike.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Your what...?
What shit, honey?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
What?
You heard me.
What about when she goes out?
Ever shot anyone?
And Flash isn't?
I know.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Harry…
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Can we make it a hundred?
Mr. Jameson--
Even if they're not clever.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Uh is a good start.
I suppose.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Oh, God, I forgot to--
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
A bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
What?
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
What's wrong with him?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl.
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Come on!
Who is it?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Twenty-five.
It's on me.
I'll live.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Jawohl?
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
No, Animal.
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
To the Brick Kremlin!
She'll never forgive me!
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
May I have this dance, Miss?
We've all done a poor job of it.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
We did it.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
I'll kill you for that!
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
You heard him.
It's working.
Captain=8A
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Twelve years, sir.
Data, are you all right?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Really? What do you feel?
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
What happened to you?
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Where is he now?
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Better?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
Close to retirement?
You could say that.
What's normal?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Calm yourself, Bones.
Still no response, sir.
Aye sir, coding now.
Later. Let's go...
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Why?
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
None that I can detect, sir.
Good shooting, Scotty.
How many more?
Saavik... Is... David with you?
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
What happened...?
What? What are you saying?
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
What about surface life signs...?
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Yours...?!

Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Yes, I was...
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... Spock...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
All true.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
You're not going in there -- !
Physician, heal thyself.
That's all you have to say?
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
Shore leave, Admiral.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Now that's what I call a meal.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
Wait --
So are we, it looks like.
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
How soon --
Let them eat static.
No!
Departing dark side, Regula.
Tactical!
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
We'll be going to warp speed --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Gentlemen, this isn't --
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Aye sir --
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
That was close --
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Prepare for warp speed.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
You sure this is such a bright idea?
What did you say she was getting?
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
You're joking...!
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
We're just -- observing.
Fundoscopic examination --
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
"Neutralized?" How?
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
Thanks.
Memory problems, too.
Then --
Just lucky, I guess.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
All right. The truth?
I'm all ears.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Spock...?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
How long, Scotty?
Full power, sir.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
You have warp capability?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
I aspire to be more than I am.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
I have to go home now.
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
Would you like something to eat?
No, we're here to... rescue them.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
No, sir...
You need a haircut, Commander.
Wine, women and song.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
How long has he been unconscious?
Is it Japanese?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
No... the door's too thick.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
What makes you say that?
Were the two of you... involved?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Unless you'd like to stay.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
My God, what happened here?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Torpedo room--?
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
What took you so long?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Surely not.
Me?
WE volunteered?
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
We HAVEN'T fired -
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
Direct hit -
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Why?
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Beverly, come in.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
What is our approximate distance?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
No.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
And you're not as we imagined you.
Praetor?
And the Senate supports you?
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
You know I need to verify this.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
You don't trust me.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
He's a very unusual android.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
Praetor.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
For the moment.
Right in line with that burning tree.
Benny, there's nothing there.
What do you do?
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Contain it and get back to me.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I just retired.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Dashboard.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Which way?
No gas.
Who?
My... husband.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
I will see it next time.
I do not understand.
Yes.
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
No.
Yes.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Go?
Yes?
Yes.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What is hell?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Horses.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I understand.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
What will you say about us?
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Tell him I'm not here.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
To the same woman?
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
I don't understand.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Judy, that's stupid.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Fuck you.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Maybe.
He records himself raping and killing her--
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
I always do.
It's alright.  He means it.
Nero.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Coming with you.
I thought we were friends.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
Whatup Lenny?
Where we going?
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
It was a tough call.
Why?
Who's Strickland?
I'm not going.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
Right.  That explains it.
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Besides that.
Anybody talk to the press?
You're thinking...?
This isn't in our database?
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
He was sitting here?
What kind?
What are you doing?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Do you think he singled you out?
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
He's called a couple times.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Start killing people for real?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Who are you?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
But why attack an Agent?
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Shit.
I know, I know.
You've been through worse.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
...maybe...
Hi.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
How was it hard?
What else?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
They're out of Glenlivet.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
The poor thing. Six years?
A couple of high rollers like you?
You have to lay it on the table.
It's a rebound.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
You're a comedian?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Hello?
I thought you met someone else.
I miss you, Mike.
...the Michelin commercial...
You don't call.
Right.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
I didn't want to say anything.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I didn't make it...
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Let's go.
What an asshole.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
Nice, baby.
Baby, you did fine.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
What?
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
Was I money?
How long do I wait to call?
That was pretty cold, dude.
You think?
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
America has been good to me...
Be my friend.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
The food is on the table.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
No.
Is it necessary?
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
But you needed a drink first.
What was this for?
For bravery.
And this?
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Corleone.
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Mike!  The party starting!
Who are those girls?
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
We're all tired...
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
Was there a definite proposal?
One of Tattaglia's people?
Will you give this to him.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Mike, why am I out?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Michael...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
What time do they expect us?
I can't...
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
Yeah.
Sure. Any time.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
I'll come down.
It's vile.
Shut up.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
It's just an undercoat. 
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
Good afternoon!
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
Sure. I love Venice.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Freddie?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
What?
Hello?
What about Christmas?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Hardly.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
I think it might hurt her to know.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I hope she never knows.
What about Cortina?
He hates being confronted.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Marge, when did you get here?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Tom?
I found Dickie's rings.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
This is spectacular.
As in the...?
What?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Of course. Aunt Joan.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
November, I thought.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Absolutely.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
You know what you remind me of?
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
Well... mostly...
Hello, Travis.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
With who?
This I gotta see.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Betsy, come over here a moment.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Could you see anything?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Huh?
What's your real name?
You can do it in my mouth.
Don't you want to go?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
How?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Why should it be grounded?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Have you tried the telephone?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
No Sir.
Also clean.
Age?
You would, huh?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Shit.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
Get it.
So howsit?
It happens.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Not really.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Stick with Carla.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Dad?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
You mean,  me?
You look... different.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
I don't smoke?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Here we are.
No wallet, huh?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Wait'll you see the inside!
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Aren't you coming?
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
You can't testify.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
So, it is a blacklist.
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
When was that?
I can play the piano?
Sit.  Play with me.
It's about me.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
I was wondering...
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Different?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Yes, I did.
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Could I have a puff?
Darling, of course I do!
I wonder if you could help me.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Where would I get a boat?
Yep?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Yes.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
We won't be here.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
They won't be.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
Then he saw.
That's the last of it.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Does this room look silly?
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
What?
Lovebirds, sir?
Aren't these lovebirds?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I think you're a louse.
So you're a lawyer.
Why... 
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
I'm sure.
Why did he shoot her?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
Yes, I was lying.
Do you expect me to believe...?
What do you want ?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
What do you do?
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Last night? What do you mean?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
So they united.
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Inland.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
Where can I find him?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
Yes, I suppose so.
I can't believe that.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
No.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
You've no thought of going there?
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
I will not have you use that name to me.
I am the best man for the job.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Was that it? Well, ok.
That was a fucking hollow point!
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
What did they give you?
Someone else did it.
I told you, I knew your sister.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Yeah, we do.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
I do. Every day.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
That can easily be arranged.
Tell me what?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Are you an FBI man?
I thought that was only for bombs.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
You think they'll ever find him?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
No foolin'? Will you?
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
About five months -- your months.
You must have come a long way.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
You know about the United Nations?
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
I wonder if we ought to--
What about him?
How do you know?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Who?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
But I suppose you know the answer.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
How do you like Santa Carla?
Why not?
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Should I run him through?
Two down and two to go.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Don't!  Stop!
Hey, take it easy.
Where you going?
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
You like Michael.
I like Michael.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Something the matter?
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
But you passed the test!
Hi...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Why not?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Do I have to do this?
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What do you want from us?
Where these tracks headed?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Let's open it.
You catch anything he was saying?
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Torch it over there!
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
MacReady!
What are you doing?
Load of bullshit.
Hey, Sweden!!!
When was the last time you used it?
How many in their party?
You reach anybody yet?
No.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Somebody definitely messed with it.
What kind of test?
What if it doesn't come?
This storm do that?
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Where was he trying to go?
So what do you make of it?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
What else can they do?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
1899.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Last night.
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
The air... the power.
No...
I don't understand.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
What?
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
I -- what are you?!
Well there's something new.
I need to... um... talk to you.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Alex... people are staring.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
Where's the challenge in that?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
In the future, we'll be better.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
That's absurd --
Did you hear me, lad?
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
His curiosity is amazing.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
And this is your "work"?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Is it?
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
So you can use it now?
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Yes, sir, he --
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
No, sir --
He said he traveled for two months.
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
No, you're safe --
They're inside --
I'm fine.
What about Starks?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Relax.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
And what's that?
Yes.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
What should they be looking for?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
You done with your small talk?
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
[Beat] What?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
I know.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
How long do we have?
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
Then, where are you going?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
Why, what would you do?
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
Exactly.
You don't understand.
How...how do you know?
Who...who kills me?
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
So what am I supposed to do?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Well, good for you.
So you never knew your mother?
Hon.
Honey?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
That's certainly possible.
I have no problem with that.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Do you love me?
Christ, sure... yes!
Call me back.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Peaches.
Hey, peaches.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Whose place is this again?
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Give me the keys.
You're not touchin' that car.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Will I be?
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Gosh.  It sure is.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Louise?
We can change our names.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
We've gone insane.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Yeah... sure did.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Gay? He said you were gay?
He implied it.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Check.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Who?
Mary.
Who?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Healy you dog!
Stalker, huh?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Same here again.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
I beg your pardon?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
We will, but first I have a surprise.
A surprise?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Mary ah, forget it.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Come on, what were you going to say?
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
I don't buy it.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Oh my.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
What do you mean 'why'?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Friend. Baseball bat.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Ho-ly shit.
You little fuck.
You were following us?
How do you guarantee that?
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Why?
An old flame?
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Ted, are you okay?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Oh... are you... ?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
So you're a writer?
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
It.
One guess.
No, no, please!
Ho there.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Uh-huh.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
Good.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Smoke.
What's it about?
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
The sun came up today.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
This is from the Highest Authority?
How long until the army is ready?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
I know, I know...
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
I don't want to listen to this again.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
You're my hero, Carl.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
How'd you know?
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
When did we get that?
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
And...
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
Who did?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
X21, give me a 20.
I read, Cooch.
Do you want a coffee?
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
You ever try solitary confinement?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
How so?
It would have been really embarrassing!
Why not?
You saw a MiG 21?
Where did you see that?
Yes, ma'am.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Two.
Um. You.
Yes. I'll give you that!
How about what?
What about the plane?
Make what?
Anything.
Danger?
Lucky charm.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
I sit. I think. I play games.
What kind of games?
Goose is dead.
Looks like a tie.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Let's hope you're right!
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
The list is long, but distinguished.
You think you can stay up with us.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Skipper, you can't do this!
Mav's a great flyer but....
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
Yes sir.
How do you feel?
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
What to the rebels want?
So, where to?
The Last Resort.
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
So why am I still alive?
Sorry.  Too perfect.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Two-headed monsters?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Sleazy...and demure.
You open it.
What is it?
You're Kuato, right?
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
Quit while you're ahead.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
Do what?
Lori, move.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
I'm not your wife.
Implanted.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Mars.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
Blondes.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
Why would I lie to you?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
What?
No problem.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Cannon fuse.
Knock it off, Burt!
I might have an idea...
You're gonna get us hung up.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Don't he have a home to go to?
Road's in!
You are so full of shit...
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Yeah, Val.
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
What?
You sure this is where it was?
Around here?  Why would they?
You okay?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
-- With objection!
Come now. Did you see the gun?
We had a description of the suspect.
Not at all --
No. No...
Of course.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
I specialize, Roger...
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
What, the lunatic who --
I feel much better now.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
But what?
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
About Chinatown. What went down.
It was self-defense.
See-cil.
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
No.
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
You getting this?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
No.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Let's ditch this place and party.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
OK, Gordon.
HE'S GONE.
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
What happened to her?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Accidental?
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Where are you going?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
You're not mad at me?
Who would do that?
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
We're on our way, Baby.
What's going on?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
What?
Hiking?
You'd think so.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
You're right. There's no one here.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
What are you doing here?
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
I'm just an M.D.
I know of him.
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
No further questions.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes.
I'm sorry...?
The most respected...
How old is he?
Yes.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Who told you that?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
If I don't 'grow up...'
What are you going to do?
I have to talk to you.
From the magazine?
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
No.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
It's locked.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Dr. Gruber.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
What do you want?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
...Gruber's not bad.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
So what?
Oh shit, what's today?
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
The broad has disappeared...
Dr. Towler...
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We, we were rather busy...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Huh.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Where are we?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
Nothing there now.
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
Colonel - shooting's no good!
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
Must be somebody in there.
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
I don't follow.
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
He's on his way.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Really?
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
Like the Genie in the bottle.
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Looks like weather.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
You okay?
I just can't believe it.
You know, I never had friends like this.
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
Is it true Phil?
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
What the hell is going on?
Fine.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Ya know... "It".
My dad.
What are they doing?
I can't go in there.
Yes, sir.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
What's on your mind?
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
Stow away?
No.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
You're officer of the watch, George.
Son-of-a-bitch.
And being sixteen.
That's enough.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
How would you know?
What?  Come on...
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Tie it off!!
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
About yourself?
What's it going to be?
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
What makes you so sure it was one?
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Yes.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
How 'bout a beer?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
No.
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
She really say she was pregnant?
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
Why should it?
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
No shit?!?! You know him?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Oh, many things...
Hasta siempre.
Hasta siempre.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
It's just another case, Sailor.
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I do.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
You ready for this?
How much we got left, honey?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
How'd you know my daddy?
There's worse places, honey.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
And Bobby too, I hear...
You talk to 'im some?...
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
I mean tomorrow.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Through the forehead?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
I didn't see nothin'...
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
It's the Chancellor.
He has a book.
So. Is he any good?
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
His parents.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
You peeked, didn't you?
No...
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Vernon.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Boy or girl?
Sure.
Hello?
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
It's very convincing.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
A little.
It's colder in there.
I'll miss my bus.
Is that really it?
That's really it.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Can I ask you something about her?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Who?
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
It's warm.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
I'm sorry.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
When?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Hey.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
That good, huh?
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
Oh?
Grady.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
I think I might have.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
The more the merrier.
I need a ride.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Yo, Traxler.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
You doing okay?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Birds.
They're starlings.
You always carry these?
I'd love to hear it.
I haven't broken any laws.
Cherry?
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Okay?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
No.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
Banished... yeah.
No thank you.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
Does he?
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
But will he... ?
Can't I stay a little longer?
What is your idea of being normal?
Please don't do it again.
What?
No, I am not going to --
Who do you see?
How old are you and your sister?
All right.
I'm all right.
Me?
You're quiet at work.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
What about bears?
So?
You think I have a problem?
Do you?
Tell me about it.
What for?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
I never hurt them. Never.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
I don't need a plant.
I'm not scared.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
I'm taking you back out.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
No.
But what did he see that made him panic?
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Jesus, Lindsey--
They'll come out after us.
How?
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Hi, lady.
No, Bud, no... not you.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
Getting a reading?
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
He can still make it.
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
And why do you tell us this only now?
Nothing... nothing at all!
Are you feeling better?
Yes, very much so.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Does it please you to say such things?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What are you saying?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Why?
I'm too sleepy.
Tell me once more.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Where is she going?
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
And where do you find the models?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Why have we stopped?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
I would like to ask you something.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
I'm being punished.
I don't know.
I don't know... I don't know...
I just heard you.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Anything... may I sit down?
Who?
How were you sick?
Down... there.
The baby they made up.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Are you married?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Everything... I don't have children.
And you're unhappy.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Agnes...
What did you do?
She watches... she listens.
And that you're stupid?
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
To help me.
Why were you afraid?
May I open my eyes now?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
I'm afraid.
I ate.
For me to get sick in.
Which one?
Who?
Go away, I don't want you here.
So I could go to him.
Him.
For what he made me go through.
Yes.
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
Something they... that they overlooked.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
I'll have it.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Marie's dead Mama.
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
Yes... I...
I can beat that.
How did she hide it during the day?
What man had access to her?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
That possibility never occurred to you?
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Not simple, no.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Earthquakes?
Was the child full term?
About what?
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Don't deny it!
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
All right?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Do you think they ever existed?
Of course.
You think she's a saint?
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
You wanted that child out of the way.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
The usual ten per cent?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
I see you go to the night court.
I've made the scene.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I don't care.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Oh, there you are!
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
I don't think that bit's right.
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Aye, I knew you were.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Out where?
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
That's all right then.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
I'll brook no denial!
Now get on with it.
No, not me.
I knew I could rely on you.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Eh, what's all this?
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Oh... God... am I cold...
I feel like shit...
... I don't know...
Where's Irth?
Can you get it a little closer?
Yeah.  Two hours.
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
What's up?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Don't you remember?
A transmission?
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It grows on you.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Oh -- God -- oh --
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Hey, guess what?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
Boy, that's terrific.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
<u>How</u>?
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Now what's wrong?
What?  What was that?
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
That's the one about the albatross, right?
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
I'll get you out of there.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Thanks.
What do you need?
How much air-time have I got?
One of 'em must have escaped.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Alright, okay.  Look...
What?  Where?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Is that a fact.
Six month stint on Datus.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Think I spoke too soon...
What can I do?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Give me a yell is something happens.
How do you know my name?
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
You're more than modest.
It needn't be.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
What a day - what a heavenly day...
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
We're?
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
I don't think I'm going.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Good luck, genius...
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Like a nylon lemon peel-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Then you're crazy.
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
How is Eve? Okay?
I'll check with Eve...
I thought you were going to be late-
I had no idea you were even here.
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
I wish it were.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Why what?
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
Is that what you want me to be?
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
Find out.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
Behind in your dues? How much?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
An answer.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
I might.
How long does it take?
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
May I have your coat?
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
No, don't go...
What - again?
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
She's just outside the door.
Harrington.
How much time have we?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
With tears.
Check.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
Lloyd, what happened...?
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
That was a pity...
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
How about calling it a night?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
How do you mean?
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--no way--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
--see?--
Facts or theory?
--we will--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
--we gotta top the Times--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
What would you have done?
I think that's him.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
I'm so glad.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
What's a real denial?
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
Which people?
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
--I'm not here.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
What I don't understand is how you got here.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Talk about Segretti--
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
James McCord.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
Lotsa hints--
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
Anyone but Bernstein.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
What else have you got?
--which Young?
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
What the hell was that?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
What are we gonna hear?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Just go!
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Um...Chris --
Hi...
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Are you kidding?  No.
You think she was serious?
Ow, what the hell?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
You're not...busy?
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
No, not again.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Oh, Kev.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Hey...
See -- this is the nicest room.
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
What?!  How do I do that?
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
What the fuck are you doing here?
The key is don't look down.
God. How can you eat like that?
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Sure. I can follow that.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Salots! Shitfucker!
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Don't you want to change?
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
They're coming!
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
We don't both have to die.
Didn't even have to ask.
What does it say?
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
Before the coma!
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Not you too -
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Uncle Terrence.
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Shit. I feel sick.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
What've you got?
What did she say?
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
Why were you so late tonight
Is everyone all right?
Poor Meetoo!
You never thought of the possibility?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
Come on!
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Dmitri didn't want the money?
What?
I cursed then all!
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
You are the boy ...
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
You gave the orders!
Hey, you on television?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
What do you mean, next?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
It's okay.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
For yuh.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Yeah.
Your grammy!
Oh, you see an analyst?
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Hey, listen, listen.
Okay?
No.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
Hey?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
M'hm.
Yeah.
M'hm.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Oh, yeah?
I know you've only known me a short while.
You don't want me to live with you?
Mine.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
It relaxes me.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Following is different. I was spying.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
What?
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Yeah.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Oh. What?
Yeah?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
What thing?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
God.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
God.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Yeah.
You look very pretty.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
The what?
This is my room.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
It's a narrow view.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Right, Max. California, Max.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Yeah, watch the road!
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
You like this house, Max?
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
So the colored have enough trouble.
They're persecuted enough!
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
Hey-
It was a wonderful set.
Yeah.
A long time.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
It's going.  It's going.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Leo?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Oh.
Borrow whatever you like.
I'll change back before we leave.
Just don't fucking tell her.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Fuck you.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
Harry called.
You need to call your dad.
Hm.  We should do it again.
It was fifteen seconds.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
I don't want to go tonight.
Happy anniversary.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Panes!  How are you?
Yes, she is.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Don't I find what?
Don't be silly.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Hm.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
What?
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
Ready to go?
Ryan!
Yes.
I so wish I'd known.
I'm so sorry.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
How?
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
I wasn't finished.
I never like to talk about my work.
Enough about me.
Ah.
Oh Soph...
And Cal's this massive adult?
Break's over.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
And you are...?
I'm Princess Bala.
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Divinely?
How should <u>I know</u>?
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Want a list?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
You're a real buddy.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
What did I tell you?
Care to make a small wager?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Twenty-seven.
Yeah.
Eight-thirty.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Why?
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
The mirror -- it's broken.
I don't understand --
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
I mean -- her apartment.
As soon as I can walk.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
What for?
You are?
You sure you want to throw that card?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Are we dressing for dinner?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Baxter?
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
How would you like to go tonight?
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Well -- I guess so.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
You left your wife?
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
What do you mean, sorry?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Mr. Sheldrake?
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
What are you going to do, Doc?
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
What about him?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
No.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
The party's over.
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
Tell me again -- what's my name?
I took sleeping pills.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Let me take that.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
How long has it been -- a month?
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Remember what we talked about?
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Are you sure that's what you want?
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Yeah, we better.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
What are you talking about?
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Go where?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
How about a drink ?
No.
Tracks ?
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
So what happened ?
Yes, sir --
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
What do you see?
Probably is.
Charlie?
Looks that way.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Can I go get those mangos now?
What'd he say?
Flood.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Which way? Right or left?
Charlie?
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
I thought he was a lame.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Wh -- what?
Can you trust them?
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
No -- no, sir.
Do you know me?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's yours?
No water.
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Were you with him, when...
What?
This one , Lance?
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
You're Australian?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
His name is...
What will you do after the war?
What's a big question?
What things?
I know.
Well , who's in command here?
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
26   CONTINUED:
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Be my guest.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Have to get these wet things off.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Don't push me..!
I already have.
Shut up!
Answer and I'll shoot!
Can you walk?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
Neff, you know better than this...
What does this matter to you?
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Thought that door was open last night...
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
Go ahead.
Do you love me?
No.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Lovely.
Two days.
Is there another way to see it?
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Fries.
You don't owe me that.
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
That seems like a good choice.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Help!
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Would you leave now, please?
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
Did you like it that much?
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
What's it mean?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
So you're practically finished, huh?
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What are you doing?
You can't --
No fucking way.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Deadline?
I bet you fucking know!
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Bullshit.
Ten million --
So this is something between you and him?
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
He was... taken.
Jesus -- why?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women?  No... not really.
Why not?
Why?
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Tell me about the first time.
Yes.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
After that?
That's fiction.
Several.
Hey, where are you?
Oh.  What do you think about?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
We split the money?
Sounds pretty well figured out.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
What happened?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
Do you have ulcers?
They're worth less points.
No?
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Why?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
What are you doing?
What?
Can I ask you something?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
It can be.
What happened to her?
Was she the only one?
Is this becoming complicated?
Honestly?
Uh-huh.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
You're very good at this aren't you?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
For what?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Taken.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Yeah.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
How would you like the funds?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Squatted it.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Like Custer huh?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Yep, except a name for this place.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
No, for the Asylum.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
Like a hand?
Red or white?
No, the boyfriend.
What happened to Katka?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Huh?
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Siberia.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Yeah, no problem.
What?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
You used to read.
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
What?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
I don't want to get in trouble.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Sure, I've done it easily.
And take Jiri with you?
What for?
No, it should be over soon.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Who you saving the dishes for?
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Just yesterday.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Yes, if you can get him free.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
She asleep?
'Bout what?
He wants to show now.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Yeah.
I meant he's a doctor.
Landon --
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
'They won't.'
-- This play means a lot to me.
No problem --
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
The world of the dead?
Belinda's a very jealous person.
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
Hey.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
I have to get you home by one.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Assholes. This happen to you?
Come on.
So what do you want to see?
What about your father?
What are you thinking?
How you doing?
How're you doing?
Can I -- go out?
Up to?
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
So talk to us about something.
Your parents are divorced?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
I thought she built it herself.
You've been well?
Yes. You?
You're marrying again.
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
When do I get time for me?
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
This... is the number one single?
This is 1952....?
Hi, Marty.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Your line, George!
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
The power converter...
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
What if you lost your keys?
An atomic bomb.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
Yeah.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Sure is pretty.
Is that right?
It's okay.
Hi.
You want to go for a ride?
Well, I got homework.
You're a redhead.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Are you sure?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
I don't blame him.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
What?
Hi.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
You didn't walk out here.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Just gimme a chance.
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Was she pretty?
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
You don't wanna know.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Stay here, I'll be back.
A what?
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
Hello.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
Well I...
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
I don't understand-
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
What do you mean, Barton?
...Barton, is everything okay?
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
Nope.
...Yeah, okay.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Fink.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Excellent picture.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
All night?
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
Did you find out about her parents?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
How's not smoking?
Yes.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
You should do something about this lock.
What are you doing here?
I passed.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
What if I call you Nicky?
How's your new book?
How's your shoulder?
Fine.  How's your back?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Did you miss me?
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
I hate rugrats.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
He was murdered.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
It teaches you to lie.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Routine.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Where the hell you goin'?
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
You knew her, didn't you?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
On what basis?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
You name it, I paint there.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
It's Andy again.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
SAMO.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
About what?
Who's John Henry?
What're you doing? You're doing something.
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
... What's the matter?
You're back.
I hadn't thought about it.
Hi.
What? What do you want?
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Uh-oh!
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Admiring your handiwork?
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Pouring myself into my work.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Your blood, Max.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
You buy this "blurry" business?
Ten, nine...
Silent night, violent night...
I don't.  So, no.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
What is it?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
I'm afraid to ask.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
What are you talking about?
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
I wouldn't bet on that.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Where is my wife?
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Why do I keep doing this?
How are you feeling, young man?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
There's one other thing. I feel..
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
How about, MR. E.
And another name for Mystery?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Wait. You can't go.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
Slanta.
To kill me.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Touchy, touchy.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
What are you talking about?
What the hell did you think you were doing?
Chase?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
No.  Wait...
Better. It's not on the market yet.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
I've considered that possibility.
Joker here. Can we talk?
Peanuts?
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Do we know anything about him?
It's the last thing we need.
David, I'm serious!
shhh...
Right first time.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Ahm.....
What happened?!!!
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
You're not going to ....
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
But is she gonna be okay?
It is urgent, sir.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Well where is she?!
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
I see it. I don't get it.
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Really? That's where we're from.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Uh, ten uh...
No, Jane.
We're rich in what really matters.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Wave at the lion.
That's how long you were gone.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Three times.  Powerful number.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What time is it?
We were trying to scare your mother.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
We're very unhappy.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Are you a spirit too?
I think so.
No, dummy.  Two.
So... You're ready for me now?
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Otho?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Stepmother's...
Answer your mother.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
They don't want to come down.
Their wedding clothes.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
... And please call me Robert.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
... But he's...?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Thank you.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Would you care for a drink?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Yes. I was.
No, thank you.
I see.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
I like to watch.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Ben is very ill.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
I feel very good in here.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Yes. I would like to do that.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
I agree.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Good night.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
So...? Where the hell is it?
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Well, Ben... I...
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
Okay.
Malkovich.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Seven-ish
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
What are you doing?
What about Maxine?
We?
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Mr. Juarez?
Yes?
I am a trained performer.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Dr. Lester. . .
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Emily Dickinson.
No, really.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
The usual, Barry.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
Hi.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
But I think I have another plan.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Says me. Do you dream often?
But of course.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
No.
How'd you get this number?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
I'm getting better all the time.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
There ain't.
Well what?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
That's the last thing they took from me.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
Was a time I knew what was.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
In case of what?
She likes this dress...
True.
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
You was friends.
Ella.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
I don't want to know.
Leave off..
You shaved.
What, baby?
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Hey!!
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
This is our concern, Dude.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Excuse me?
Can we just rent it from you?
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
Yeah.
Where you going, Dude?
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
It's already posted.
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
They were Nazis, Dude?
What do you need that for, Dude?
Please!  Please!
And was there anything of value in the car?
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
In the briefcase?
No.  Here.
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Far from it.
Take it easy, Dude.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Now I got--
The main guy, Dieter--
Well yeah...I know that.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
So...that doctor.
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Yeah, but--
Theodore Herzel.
No, you're not wrong--
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
That...fucking...bitch!
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Wooden bridge, huh?
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
Whose toe was it, Walter?
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
And the fucking money!
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
This driveway.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
Walter, you fuck!
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Employed?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Walter--
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Why?
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Blade.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
You're hurting me.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Thought you were dead.
What's going on?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Any casualties?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Going somewhere?
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
How can you tell?
Some kind of archive --
Is he sick?
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
We keep in radio contact.
How did you escape?
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Not that I can see.
Domini?
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
Oak?
No.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
You said the name "James."
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Nothing. I dunno--
I know, I know.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
Does it hurt?
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
We should be so lucky.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
Boy Kurth.
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
What're you doing?
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
Spite.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
What--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
What're you nuts--
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
She got <u>paid</u>.
What?
Elly Kedward?
Are you alright?
What?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
....Ma'am?
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Yes.
What was that?
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Abby... you all right?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Where is everything?
It'll pass.
Yeah.
How long did you watch her?
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
I didn't say that.  Well?
I want you to go fishing.
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
...it's too damn risky.
...Count it if you want.
What's this?
Red Label.
...Why?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Come into the study a minute.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
No. not at all.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
. mommy's here.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Frank?
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Shit. You better tell me something.
No. Come on.
No.
No.
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you know?
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
I want you to hurt me.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Yeah, it's me.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Shh. I'll tell you.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
What else is new?. right?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
What happened to him?
Now, how are you going to do that?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.
Yeah. but.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
Did you see her undressed?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Oh yeah?
Okay.
... You look beautiful.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Are you kidding?
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Yeah.  She told me.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
Because I got caught.
But you must.  It's the only way.
George.
Touche.
Where do I put this!?
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
No more brothers, Diego.
You fucked me, Diego.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
I want money.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
You mad at me?
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Figured it out.
George.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Pablo said no?
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
But this is...
Mirtha, how are you doing?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
You mean, like a trip?
You swear?
It's alright, Dad.
I fucked up.
But I have a visitor.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
For instance, something like this?
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Stoned?
Nice weed, huh?
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
And you believe the NLF?
And here?
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Don't move, Hacene.
What's happened to you?
With an unloaded pistol?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
I don't do that kind of thing.
Then don't complain.
Where's Kader?
A name?
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Who is speaking?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Increase his heart rate.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
What did they argue about?
That's ridiculous.
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
No.
A little after eleven.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
No -- never.
Who found him?
About a year and half ago.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
What happened next?
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
It didn't.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
We stopped seeing each other.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
What happened?
Yes.
I've tried it.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Something like that.
Yes.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.
That wasn't the deal.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
Because I'm expecting a call.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
If you want me to.
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
What time did you leave?
Well, that's a long time.
What?!
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
Don't say that!
Not yet. You want to go?
Did we want to?
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
No, really?
So, how long you've been living here?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
No, your kids.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
And clean.
Feeling better?
Much.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
You ought to write these stories down.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
What?
You must get lonely at times.
Why doesn't it scare you?
But no one in particular.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
My mistake. I apologize.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
Am I interrupting anything?
Oh, sure. Great.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Well, what is this?
What do you want me to say?
No one's asking you to!
Want anything special for dinner?
Hmm?
Okay.
What's her name?
About an hour ago.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
You want us to move in here?
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Where's the others?
That's what?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Just try it.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
I lied.
How do you know?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Why?
And you believe her?
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
I'm here.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
What building?
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Nice rack.  How old is --
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
You was just doing your job.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
You haven't?
You gotta use your imagination.
That building?
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
You want to get into this now?
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
How the fuck can I open it?
Caesar!
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
What are you talking about?
No!  They're still on their way.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Got to think this through ...
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
The money?  The money's gone.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Stupid cunt!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Now that's teamwork.
Where is it?
Why?
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
See?  We're for real.
So this is temporary for you?
Oh, I'm sorry --
Not exactly.
Curious, maybe.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
No.
He's a launderer?
What?
What are you afraid of?
What the fuck was it?
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
What choice?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Do you think you know me like that?
Yes.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Yeah, twice.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
What did Gino drink?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
An accident.
He'll have to run.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
How'd it go?
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
No.  We can't risk it.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
I don't think so.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
-- sir? --
You are a friend of his?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
We thought you were gone for good.
So what's in Paris?
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
What does that mean?
Okay, so...
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
You knew he was coming.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
xxxxxx
He run away often?
Get in the basement.
Wait a minute --
xxxxxx...
Tell him we're busy.
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What?
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
How did I get here?
... And then some.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
You don't have to sing it.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
You sound worried.
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Even later.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
How much do you know?
I'm sure you have
What's she done?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
They weren't at school with us.
Do you know what you're doing.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
How could you do this to me?
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
You know, smoking's bad for you.
It's my fucking life.
I didn't like it.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
What's going on here?
We've got both.
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
I thought you arrested me.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
We? Don't blame me!
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Oh my God, a mistake!
Don't worry.
A cheque.
The refund for Tuttle!
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
That's it.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Sam Lowry.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
What have you done with his body?
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
Put the phone down and your hands up.
My I.D. cards.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
No, no, that's impossible.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
He's going to be all right, right?
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Our Lady of Misery.
He's working a double shift.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
You asked me not to come.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
The family know?
Last show of the night.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
The brakes are shot.
I've taken that into consideration.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Shit, shit, shit...
What did I do to you?
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
They booted me out of Washington.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Okay.
He must have been great-looking, right?
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
What happened?
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Then it went well.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
I think you're the Devil.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
What did he say?
We could...
Should I...
No stop where he's all besieged.
They're not really going to call security are they?
Follow me.
Nobody else had it.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Oh.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
What?
Bye, sweetie.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
What do you mean clean?
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
What?
Well, what is it?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
It's not important.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Okay.  Good night.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
That's yes?
Take it easy.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Are you okay?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Uh-huh.
Don't you work here?
I just might.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Are you nervous, Walter?
Um...
Whaddya mean?
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
You really like it?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
What's it called?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Look at the size of it!
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Walter!  Jeez!
Thank you.
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Forget it.
Walter...there's...
That's word for word.
Nothing...nothing at all.
Now what kind of statue was that?
What did he say?
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
No...look I'm busy...
Hello, Walter.
I also saw the girl give you this.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
Well I'm overjoyed.
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Hi.
I thought you didn't respect money!
What do you get?
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Oh, OK.
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
I'm fine.
Yes.
Dying.
Maybe.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
No, you didn't.  When?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Why'd you come back?
That's me.
Are you okay?
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Beverly Center.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
China.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
Where's the other one?
Meet me at this address after school.
Uh... gym.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
No -- you don't have to --
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
What!?!
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Not if you're careful.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Hi.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
You think so?
What happened?
Buffy!
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
The homelesses?
Oh, yeah!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Oh, thank you very much.
So, we're stupid now?
Except for Prom.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
I know what it is.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
I'd like you to meet my father.
It's Skip, for you.
I'm Crash Davis.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
And now you wanta teach me?
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Annie---
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
Which one of us?
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
You a God damn witch?
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Fastball.
Well, I held it like an egg.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
Pussy.
We'll be praying for you.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Little high.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
It's a damn convention.
What'you want, kid?
Who ain't?
Ain't here.
Where does he go?
Well, I'd rather not say.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
You were wandering around.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Oh, good.
Wait, hold on a second.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
You lost your control.
All right.
Yeah.
My wife?
Okay?
It's none of my business?
What - what, Caesar's?
How'd you know I was here?
Well...
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
I'll come by.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Hello.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
...and she doesn't always -
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
Certainly.  Senator.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
Yeah, I know all that.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
No.
You can trust me.
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
I gotta tell ya...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
Pretty serious.
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
I threw it away.
I had a... salad.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
You understand? What? Let you go?
I wouldn't -
You get down here!
I am not!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Eight children! 
Yeah, okay.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
Can't do it with both hands?
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
No, no? You didn't?
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Hey.
You just - Just stop him.
Pitch-black?! It -
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Is that what you did?
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine left?
Artie!
Artie! Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
I know.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I understand.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Yeah.
Fine.
Hi, how are you?
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
I can see that. Sure.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Mm-hm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
No, he's not.
Nicky, please...
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Get lost?
Yeah.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
We'll go later.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
...they're in Penthouse K.
I think that's it.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Get up.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
This is Nick.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Charlie M?
I'm positive.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
Again!
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
In women?
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
What's the catch?
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
I loved you.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
You're late.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
You seem sad, Spooky.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
I don't see anybody in there but you.
What if they do question the authenticity?
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Who's on the phone?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
You never miss a trick.
And stop with the directions.
Any minute.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
I don't believe you.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
What makes you say that?
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
Hey drop it, okay?
And that was the end of it?
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
A price on everything.
What's happening?
Not a chance.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Why tell me this?
No.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Yes.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
They put their hands all over me.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
The guy with the transplant.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
A typical fuck-up.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Stop talking like that!
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
That's not good enough.
Five ... six.
I don't want it.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Count it.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Scottish?
She's not a girl, Col --
What you think?
Maybe he wants something.
You see that, Col?
Don't be like that --
See, they get the wrong idea.
Take your clothes.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Not me.
You old-fashioned?
He was different.
As different as it's possible to be.
You say that like a gentleman.
Must be.
You could?
Made me feel all funny inside.
Kind of wish I didn't.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
I miss you, Jimmy.
Why, honey --
She's the thing you had to tell me.
You could say that.
Do you like me even a little bit?
Why?
You want to make me look like him...
Don't call me that --
For me.
So tell me.
Are you all right, Dil?
Why?
Never.
She was --
Yes.
What was it?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Hey -- what's he like?
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
He's hot.
I know.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Jude?
Give him a cup of tea.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Thanks.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Now put it back in.
Why?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Depends on what you believe in.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
When I was a child...
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Take the hood off, Fergus --
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
What?
Not here.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
How was I leading you on?
That's right.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Adam --
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Lord, you're stubborn.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
But I didn't kill anybody.
You lied to me so many times --
I heard you, I heard you.
His -- real -- ?
Thanks very much.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Why not?
Café.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
It's Charles!
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Then how do I know this is your office?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Starting with his own.
Oh.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
Sorry about that.
Very pretty. Now what?
Me?
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Reggie -- listen to me --
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
I'm afraid it is important.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
Forty-five thousand.
Not unless we're blind.
Tell me what?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
You loved him?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Is it all right?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
I don't understand.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Voilà what?
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
How do you know?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Do you know what you're going to do?
What was all that?
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
Who said?
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
How do you shave in there?
Do you know what's wrong with you?
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
So they think he left it with you.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
I get the imports.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
is there anything you do?
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
I'm not.
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
Is Jody still awake?
Well?
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
She works at a church?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Daddy....
You're not?
We just found another body.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Yes.
Why?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
He says he loves me.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
What?
I won't.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Why?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Why?
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
My dad's down there!
Yeah.
Kenny's aunt?
What are you doing?
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.

Freezer in the back.
Great. 
Since when does...
Well, he told me to collect cash.
...moron.
Except for the fact that I need cash.
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
No, no, no.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
...fine.
...-damn!
Shut up.
Kiss my ass!
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
...truck!

Holy shit...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
I think...
That's right.  Now,  move!

Goddamn!
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
...Pete.  Come on.
Whoo!
I made it!
 Gee, you think so?
Okay.
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Oh, no!
...-tion?
...overdrawn bank accounts.
...truck.
 Yeah.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...
...-er.  It was your friend...
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
A-And you  owe me...
Are you all right?
Listen, Arlo.
Arlo!  Arlo.
Yeah.
Okay, here we go.
We!
And Brynner's right on...
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What?
We got-...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

...-tiatin'.
That was quick.
What'd he say?
Well, that just about figures for today.
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
...take my sorry old truck.
...owe you.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
All right.  After they put you away...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
...happen if I drop this?
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...

This is it.
...comes up that road.
It's clean.
Get your links set up!
Where's their protective...
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
I don't see my container.



Dead, last time I...
 ...checked. 


...ready before the morning crowd blows in.

Forty-nine?
...tight!
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
...-five.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
He's brains without ambition...
And only then does our noble friend realize...
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
...there's a colonel...
Get in 

Negative.  Negative.
Take it easy, Jake.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Always?
It doesn't hurt.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Do you know him?
Too bad?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
What is it?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
She's just no good.
I'll just tell my wife.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
Yes.
The apple core club.
I'd like to talk to him.
Or her name?
Matter of fact I do.
Where?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
What for?
Of course.
A complete surprise?
Not that Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
What do you mean?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
K... Cross.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Of course I'm sure.
What dam?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Hold still. Why?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
He owns it. You know?
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
You mean she just found out?
I want to see her.
What did you do that for?
Katherine.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
I think I got something.
Ida Sessions.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Oh my goodness.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
He never even kids about it.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Yes...
Mr. Gittes?
Well, no.
It's bone dry, Morty.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Yes. No.
Yeah?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
Fifty lire... 
Then why don't you change jobs? 
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Father, I have sinned...
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
I didn't see that.
I can't take shorthand.
You know why?  She was so -
I'm going back there.
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Ask them to sit down.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Emily!
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
No.  But you're close.
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
I'm not sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Charlie -
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
Brad, you are drunk.
Are you finished?
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
I know you will.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Yes, sir.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
How did you meet him?
What about that apartment?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You can hold me down.
Can I join in?
Can I use the bathroom?
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
I'm not pregnant.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
But you were.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
How'd you get here so fast?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You're late.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
That's what I said.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Why?
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Seven months.
That's cheating?
That girl was vile to you.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
And you figured it out?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What did he say?
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
What?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I'm going to miss the game.
Don't yell at me, pal.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Why not?
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
You hardly knew her!
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
He made it, hunhh?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
I don't want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
May I be blunt with you?
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
I didn't think they even enforced this.
What did she say?
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Leave me alone.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
How do you figure?
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Go open the video store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
It's not my store.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Lasagne.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
At least they weren't lit.
How much money did you leave up there?
Really?
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
Who?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Dante...
HOW MANY?
What is it?
I'm not out of shape!
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
No way!
What did he say?
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
You'll be missed.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
I... I don't know what to say.
You're not?
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Answer the man.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
She's losing it!
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Take the gun.
Two...
Enough.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
Maybe lead to a flare up...
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
What if he can't?
What are you doing here!?
Let's be creative.
Gabe...your arm?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
What?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Don't let me fall!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
No, he's gone.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
Have her come up.
Who's going with you?
Right.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
Good morning, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Phoned some friends, sir?
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Thank you very much, sir.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
No, sir, I feel really great.
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
You're gonna be sick are you?
Alexander de Large, sir.
Murder, sir.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
C of E, sir.
Lice?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
How are you feeling today?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
Indeed.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
You like being a lawyer?
Bottega.
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Something going on?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
It's nothing.
I brought you flowers.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
He's not paying you one cent!
Jesus, what is with this guy?
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
First time in New York?
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
You prefer nights?
You mean like benefits?
Me, specifically?
Max.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
No.  You say you're cool.
Max.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
Jazz.  Music.
You mind?  I'm working here.
Leave me alone.
She's in the hospital.
Limos, huh?
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
What happened?
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Who?
Some living.
Then what are you?
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
Not for years.
You're certifiable.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
Shoot.
So what's the question?
That was him.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
Jerry, I --
Now what?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Blue moon...
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
I'm not sure what you mean.
You made your decision yet?
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
And what did I say?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Yes.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
So?
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
David --
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
What?
You...
Right.  Well.
Thank you?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
What?
No primer.
I can't move any smaller.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
So who...?
So we passed some kind of test?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
So.  What happens now?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
And in return?
I'd say this is slightly different.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
That you, Valerian?
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
'My father's house has many mansions.'
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
You're willing to die for this.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I do.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
But I made this arrangement --
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Git to work!
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
You can't do that!
Whatcha got?
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
We got it locked in the sock.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
But, Luke...
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
You just said he could eat anything.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
Stop that.
No. No chains either.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
Now look what you did.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
He was lying.
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
You already made the delivery?
The door was already open...
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
You know I can't do that.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
Is he out?
Who?
For months... last October.
That's no surprise.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
Open the door.  Please.
He was in my apartment!
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Because it's your job, that's all.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Not a lot of action here.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
So - why the airport?
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
You're kidding.
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Do we have to talk about this?
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Yeah, everything's under control.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Paul could pop the question at any time.
I gather he's late as usual.
Tomorrow?
You too, Mom.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Yeah?
Green spot.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Do you?
It's TV heaven.
Are you OK?
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
You don't have a fever.
Sure. Why?
I'm going to the store.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
It's Elvis...
You're there now?
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
They're gonna be what?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
And for my help I would get what?
Half the tapes.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
You want Zero to kill him?
No.
Hadley --
Does it really matter what I say?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Everything.
Everything?
No, I didn't.
Yes.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
I knew I should have driven.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
-- I want to be Elvis.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
How do we know what room she's in?
Glenmorangie.
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
She seems pleasant enough.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
A little?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
I didn't have the heart.
Do you think you are a real master?
Tell me, who is your master?
Shut up!
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Hello.  What is your name?
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Please.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
No, really?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
I'll give them to you.
You, sister...
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Give it back!
Jen...
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
What was it?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
No.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
But don't be too lenient.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
They're gone.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
No onions though, okay?
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Fucking A, my friend.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
It's only a flesh wound.
It's just the dope, don't worry
Mister Funboy.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
What's going on...?
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I went to see a friend of mine.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Top Dollar.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Go away.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Thank you.
Excuse me?
You what?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Nothing.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You talking to me?
You implied it.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
That's none of your business.
Doing what?
Without question.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
No, not at all.
Of Human Bondage.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Hi.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
Schwarz. Jewish?
Where did you say she's from?
What do you mean?
Outstanding.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Where did you find those?
That's great.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Okay.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Well did you like it?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
You think he'll like it?
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I know.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Yes!
Where is she?!
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Sorry.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Sounds intriguing.
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Interesting.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Ronald?
I accept. Now get out.
I can't thank you enough.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Nope.
What are you talking about?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
You get your wish!
Where did you get this ring?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
I got my wish anyway.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
Irena.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I know that.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
What do you mean?
Did you hear the child out?
Ollie.
I live right here.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
It was on account of the birthday party.
Just you wait!
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
A princess?
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
But what happened to the little deer?
It got hit.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
Mommy read it to ne.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Let the child stay.
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Wow your body's really hot.
What else is there?
Does she have PMS?
Maybe he's just shy.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
I don't know.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
Are those Mark's?
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Okay. I guess so.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Holy shit, I don't know.
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
What happened to his tooth?
Why the fuck would you do that?
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
You're such a good friend.
So what do I do?
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I guess you'll find out.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
They say sex is great for cramps.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You look different. I mean you look good.
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
My bra is my biggest supporter.
On your desk.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
It's stupid.
No, why?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
Except Mark of course.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
You know, I've never seen your cat.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
It's for you. Frida.
You want her sheets?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What are you talking about?
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
Police.  Nobody move.
Just visiting my patient.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
In there.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Iím sorry...
Go on.
Look!  This is a good one!
You know something about me?
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
What?
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Choices???
Where's the girl?
TilT we figure something out.
Is that everybody?
What about her.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
Clean.
Clean.
Oh.  Excuse me.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Dave -- I'm working.
This is undeclared income.
Choices?
Will he be alright?
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
This is wrong, Alan!
Now he's making stuff up about me.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
What?
You mean with you and everything?
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
You're kidding.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
What?
... How could I what?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Anybody would have done it.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
You1re leaving, too?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
I really don't have much of an appetite.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
I know.
They're crucifying you out there.
Hi.
I never thought I'd...
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
All set.
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
What is it?
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
Gasparilla?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
The hospital? 
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
Dios mia.
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
Sounds boring to me.
They're townies?!
Charlie Dalton.
What is the point?
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
But...
Doing fine, sir.
What happened? Were you kicked out?
No.
This is stupid.
What are you doing?!
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
Knox, I don't believe this!
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.
What is that?
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Yes sir.
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
YAWP!
AHHHHHH!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
I was just looking in an old annual and...
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
And now he will?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Er  No.
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Who?
Which question is that?
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Did you clear this?
That's where my boat's moored.
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
I saved your life is what I did!
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
You people...rich people...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
What is it?
What?
Let's just keep going.
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
Hanover!! Hanover!!
...Jagger was here...I was here...
What did you do the my kids!!
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
And what have you come up with?
Joey...
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
She fucked you?
Those are mine!
That's mustard!
What?
Get the boots.
Here's to huntin'.
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
I thought that was it.
What the --!
It won't open.
Sure. Why not.
Where? Where is he?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
No. None of that.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Naw.
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Yeah?
Vince. Hey, you guys --
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
You Biederman?
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
How are you?
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I... No. You do this for money?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Huh?
The shot?
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
From Nam?
What'd he say?
Is he from here?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
How's Linda?
Here, here! This is it!
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
No.
Yeah.
Phantom Mary?
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Cynthia! Sure.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
The fuck I did!!!
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Yeah?
Kimberly!
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Need help?
I'm ready.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Married?
I'll have a cup of coffee?
You want to be a good detective?
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
What's this?
...What are you talking about...?
...Have you been drinking?
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
I just heard.
But he was such a good cop.
Seat's too high.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
Who are these people?
It hasn't opened yet?
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
What's that, sir?
Anybody can see that.
No! No! I won't.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
No, Stone!
Mornin', Jabez ...
Where did it come from?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
You know darn well it is.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Oh!
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Well -- what are we going to do?
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Jabez!
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Jabez ...
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Worried!
I'm serious.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Why don't they come --
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
The police...?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
I'm going to count to three...
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
I...have a request.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Holly Gennero?
Roy?  You still with us?
Yeah?  What's the odds?
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
These seats come out?
Jesus, you're the man!
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
You'll be okay.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Hello, Sonny.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
So... that sure is something.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
Would you do something for me? Please?
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Oh no!
He's makin' threats in there.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
... armed robbery ...
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Don't fuck with me ...
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
The gun's right on your back...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
What if I take you with me?
What now, Sonny?
Sure - we like you.
Thanks again, Sam.
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
You're serious!

We'd kill ourselves.
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Okay, when do I get them?
I don't want him.
I am.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Oh my God, mother!
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
<i>He killed two children.</i>
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Hello?
Yes.
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Is that you, Domino?
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
God help us. God help us all.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
How you be?
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
My brother.
And?
So, in other words, you are not down.
Mookie.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Good morning.
Ten.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
Hurry up and get dressed.
How many you say?
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Sal, I want my money.
Do we now?
Keep it.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Shit!  I forgot.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
Then we'll do something else.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
Feels good.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
I was going to buy a slice.
I'm listening.
Some are OK.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
How do you know this?
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Excuse me.
In the new library there.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
HARRY!
Would you like something to drink?
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Home school? What's that?
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Got any crazy eights?
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Can he do that?
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
...cause you said...
What?
Nope. I was right.
Shut up!
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Go away, assface.
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
No. What happened?
I know I did.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Ready Lloyd?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Right.
So can I come along?
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
TURK, leave him alone.
TURK, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
That's my boyfriend.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
God, I've missed you.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
It's the big potato.
And...?
Knock knock.
What?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
What's that you're saying?
We felt his presence.
Is this what you seek?
Would you really have drawn my blood?
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Always.
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Why were you buying a coffin?
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
Goulash.
What's in the needle?
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
What happened?!
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Jesus!  Are you serious?
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
What do you mean?
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
I guessed.
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Ed, it was only one review.
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
It takes me comfortable.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
You're a fuckin' mess.
I'm going to my mother's.
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Hruphh...?
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Mr. Reynolds!
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
My eyes are killink me.
Tits.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
Oh.  Congratulations.
I am.  How's your father?
Did you find it boring?
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
What was that?
Uh, atomic energy?
Dynamite --
Let's get married.
Huh?!
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Yes!
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Yes!
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
I'm moving out.
What?
This is real, Bananahead!
You know what would be great?
What did you study?
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --

What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
You said that.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I mean, that worked out.
Yes.
He says --
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Oh God. What hospital?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
What are you talking about?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
What are you doing?
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
You batted or you bunted?
Well, when you put it that way.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I wish my stepfather was here.
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
Come on, let's go.
No... Could you?
What's up?
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Why do you do that?
What?
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Who is it?
You watching the ballgame?
Good-bye, brother!
Me?! That's you!
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Hello.
You don't recognize me.
Oh, man! So...
What...
Mm.
We don't have foibles.
That's the point -- this could change things.
Sign here, please.

Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
How'd it go?
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
You know what they say about the early bird.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
I'm looking at new cars.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
So... what do you have to tell me?
And when did you do it?
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Door was open.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
What do you mean?
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
What?
I don't care.
For what?
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Paul, get out!
You dumbshit!
Yes.  But do you know?
It's Lynn.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
Of course... But how?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
What are you talking about?
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Thanks, but no thanks.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Where are the police academy files?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
You're wrong.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Why?
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
What's this all about, lad?
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Even I'm not that crazy.
What?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
What?
Bud White's been here?
A vulgar term, but yes.
Why not?
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Do you have any proof?
You're back, boychick.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Something like that.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Listen--
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
I don't know who he is.
Really?
Yeah.
It's a SAT-tracker.
I'll pay you.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Jesus!
Sorry.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Yeah.
Who?
Here?
Gimme that.
You sure?
Fuckin-A.
No he won't.
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
Listen--
What if--
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
He came in four minutes ago.
Because my life is being ruined.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
A report?
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Uh-oh.
Right.
What?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Stacy?
Stacy--
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
What happened to your head?
You opened the thing?
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
You being audited?
We believe he did.
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
What's his name?
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
It's okay to use the phone.
What?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
They killed Rachel.
Why would they--
I don't know!
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
He got hit by a bus.
You think there was a connection to--
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Lyle?!
We don't know.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Federal Express?
Yes?
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Excuse me?
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
Why did you follow me yesterday?
What do you mean, poetry?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
No.
You don't sew at all!
Now.
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Tell me about your garden.
Could I trouble you for some water?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
No.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Ask him.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Oh, all over.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Oh.
Apprentices.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
To arm-twisting.
Excuse me -
Yes?
I'm still here.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
Why would anyone do this?
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
Kip - come and dance with me
What are you up to?
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Only we have to go to work.
I was looking forward to this evening.
Certainly not.
I don't think so.
What about your rank or serial number?
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Mac's signature.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
We're getting close.
Are you...okay?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
A film case.
You're late.
True enough.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Got it.
Aren't we early?
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Your share.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
You have something in mind?
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Relax, don't jam it...
Jesus.
He looks familiar.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Gin, really.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
The early bird gets the damn worm.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
250,000?
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Whoa.  Remind me.
What the hell is this doing here?
So you say.
Yes?
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Yup.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Course I did.
I don't get why they'd do that.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
It's not about working hard --
How many families we talking about here?
Is that what I think it is?
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
How dare you take that away from me.
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Erin?  What are you --
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
I wasn't gonna --
When'd they file the demur?
Did he say why?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
You come to the right place.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Annabelle Daniels.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Which number do you want, George?
You got a little girl?
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
You must survive, Luke.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks a blue streak.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Barks his consternation.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Because of my father, I guess.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
What is it?
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
That was no earthquake.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Yes, you do.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Can you trust him?
No thanks.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Get out of here, Lando!
This ought to be good.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
What??
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Why not me?
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Free your mind and return he will.
Will they die?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
I'll die first.
The Hoth System?
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
Zira, are you mad?
And we can watch ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Ooww!
Where is he?
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
Does he know how to activate it?
I said pull over.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
What're you doing in here?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
Of Merlin?
Whose son am I?
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
Excalibur! Is it true?
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
Rise, Mordred.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
You, my lord.
Who?!
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
No, no, of course not. You are young...
A lovestruck page!
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
Now you must pay me.
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
It's-
Hi, how'd your day go?
What's this?
It's serious?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Would you like some more coffee?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
A man to see you.
A stimulant.
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Are you sure?
No.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
I beg your pardon?
Like what?
In Europe.
Oh look at that.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
I believe you.
Goodnight Dims.
Intensely.
It would bring us together.
Ego te abslovo.
Bon Jour.
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
What's this about?
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
I once did a paper on it
From the psychiatric end.
Yeah, a fall.
Unlikely.
Very much.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
No.
I'm afraid.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Twelve years.
Trunks?
Well, look at this.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
No.
Two at a time?
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Oh my God ...
How we doing?
What's the point?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
What's wrong with it?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
So we on tomorrow night?
You're their uncle.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Why the interest?
So do I.
Nice, huh?
The hell you don't.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I'm not unhappy.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
What's the matter?
No.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Very realistic.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Last?
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
We're gonna be here a week?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
Fine.
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
A useless talent.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
Fuck you.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Actually, that's my stage name.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
This is show business?
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
We're a team.  We work together.
What-?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
They're tight.
I said I was sorry.
Baker's unabridged.
Go ahead.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Wow. You ever see her again?
What's with you two?
Is that important?
I'll call you.
Thanks.
All right.  Hold on.
Black.  Labrador.
Frank works hard.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Like a baby. You?
What's the matter?
You're upset.
You were good.
Soap convention.
He called her.
Coffee?
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Let me get the light.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Yeah?
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
... Thanks.
And this thing can grow it?
Why would he need more?
Pollux ...
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
Not anymore.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
When did you start smoking?
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Get rid of them.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
What is with you tonight?
Gone?
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
Great.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Excuse me?
Hello?
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
What about me?
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
Rise...and...shine...!
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Five thirty.  Okay.
Trouble at work?
So Jack, it’s your wife’s birthday, got anything to say to her?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Where’s my car?!  Where’s my Ferrari!?
Like I said, it's a business deal...
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
All in one tape?
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Why not?
Jack...
...my feet are hurtin’...
Hey!  I was watching that!
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Well...Annie for one.
How was the game, honey?
Jack.
I need to tell you something.
But you always seem so certain.
That’s a big one for me, too.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Think bigger.
A perk for what?
Annie goes to a great school.
But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jack.
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Hey, my wife’s in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
I want to see you again.
You didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
The shields on the station should protect us.
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm worried about you.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
Oh, he did.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
And where do we think we're going?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Apparently I can disappear.
They're ready for you, sir.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
What?  What do you mean you --
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
'Scuse me.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
Okay to proceed.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
The Other Side got to him.
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Yes?
We must!
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
What's that?
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
All in all, quite a canoe...
What happened?
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Can I see your license and registration please?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
Clear him off the road.
She started shrieking, you know.
One of us pays the other for half.
Huh?
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Mm.
Where you girls from?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Yah?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
We run a pretty tight ship here.
... I'm sorry, sir?
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Yah, real good.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Know who this is?
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Stan and I're okay.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
No, no, that's fine.
Well, they're a good outfit.
I'm sorry, Mike.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
It's okay...
Anyone else residing there?
Hello?
Margie Olmstead?
Linda Cooksey?
Gustafson's accountant.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Hon?
Yah?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Your mallard?
It's terrific!
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
We need to talk.
Sure.
I'll expose you.
Why are you doing this?
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
How did you find me?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
What are you talking about?
I don't know ...
You hear that?
No.
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
You are an insane person.
... and you come home to this.
You were in here last Thursday night.
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
What list?
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Would that be a problem?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
They're called "cigarette burns."
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
I don't know about this.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Yes, I promise.
What... ?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
What should I have told you?
I want to know --
I want to hear the truth.
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
... is over.
"Too young?"
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb?
Abort the plan.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
S-S-Stuff.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Should we knock?
I'm not sure I understand.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
What?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
You mean Alex Browning.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Whoa, nine months?
Shouldn't we pull over?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Sure.
It's only the end of June.
"It?"
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Remember the departure time?
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
You're the fuckin' devil.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Ever do this from a jet?
Show me how it operates.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
What's she saying?
What's that?
American?
Roundeye.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
And how'd you sneak up like that?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
This your stuff?
What did you want?
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Will it hurt?
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
No, I'm fine... really...
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Hello Lydia?
Yes.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well there....  What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
So how do we do this?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
My name is Parry.
They're --  -- What?
<u>What</u>?!
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
But I gave it to you!
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Who are you talking to Jack?
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
I advise you to let us go.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
What are we about to do?
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
You have a disease.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
You can sing the song.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
You treat me like I was.
You like it?
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
What?
I didn't get it, did I?
Can I get you anything else?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
No. We have tomatoes.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Well, you seem very professional...
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Well...  I better let you...
Yeah, me, too...
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
What?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
I guess you fell in the water.
That's dangerous, you know.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
What?
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
I don't think that's true.
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
You better hold onto your tongue!
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
Steam.
If you want to call it that.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
What are you doin' here?
So what you think of me?
They are?
Pitt.
Eddie from Compost?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Not really.
Where you know Amanda from?
You mean her.
I have no idea.
Nineteen.
Ask anybody.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
No children?
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Oh, he was dying for years.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Breathe easy...
There is?
Okay. Some idea.
Like tonight.
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Jesus.
Gum thought Brazil.
Can I get you something?
Oh my God!
Here you are, Doctor.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
You may be right.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Right.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Will you kill me?
Can I steal you for a minute?
'Magic' today, huh?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Did you say cops?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Who is it?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Are you still in love with Alan?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Don't tell me I can't --
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
So you're saying she moved out.
What did you want under the bed?
Two...
Who? Donnie and Marie?
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
Jim Swarthout?
But I ain't got you...
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Excuse me?
Actually, you may take it all now.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
So what about this watch?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
You gave it to the girls for one.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
People still watch that?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Who's my real father, man?
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Fine!
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
Shit.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
How nice.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Allo... Salvatore...
Who's this --
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
I got no music!
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
What's he do?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
You want some eggs.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Who is that guy?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
Why not?
What happened to you?
Why is it called Hellgate?
No, I don't.
So what?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
I'm off.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
No.  This isn't what you think.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
You ready?
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Huh?
You call your son Little Chief?
What'd you say your name was?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
What the hell...
I'm thirty-five years old.
I never knew you, Dad.
On the job?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
When?
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
You're not looking too good.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
Which means he probably knew her.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
What're you gonna do?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
Derek... stop.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Did you stay here last night?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
You're Shelly?
Please... be cool.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
I just want you to like me.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Ahh, nothing.
Wait a minute. I just...
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
I need to talk to you.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Twenty.
Look, I don't want your money!
What do you want?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Tell me!
Her name's Stephanie.
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Oh, my dear God...
I've told you the truth.
I know what it sounds like.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Right.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
What's that?
What are you doing in here?
Where did you get that alcohol?
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
What are you doing??
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
I don't know what to say...
When did this start?
Rennie...
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
But Rennie...
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
We must abandon.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Shut up, Elliot.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
He'll hate it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
She's dying.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
This is how we've managed to last.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Do you want to get some coffee?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Is it?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
What do we want?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
This could be it!
You know the answer to that.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Where's your elastic brace?
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
It's a complicated subject.
Because life is good.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
Why?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes, Peter.
You know what.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Do you think he can do it?
No one's waiting.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Yes.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
God gave you ten thumbs.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I'm sorry.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
Do you find me stubborn?
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
Who is that young man?
We need your help!
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Grudges?
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
From what budget?
What are you waiting for?
Surely you know what you have.
It's about the Director.
You okay, Jerome?
Let's get out of here.
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
Come on--we're taking off.
You really had other offers?
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
Hugo!  I've found him!
No.
I envy you, Jerome.
All it takes is a long arm.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Beynon.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
We'll try again.
You okay?
You want to drive?
It doesn't look like that.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
What's Beynon got set up?
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
What do you want for dinner?
After four years and now the question comes up.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
That doesn't hurt.
I mean it.
Doc...
When are you going to learn?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Okay?
We're going to make it.
We got this far.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
What now?
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Oh my God.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Chicago.
You were with him?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Then you do it.
Drive.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
You do what he says, Harold.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
How long have you been married?
You can't get away from me, Albert.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
What did he say?
What happened to this car?
Oh ay?
Yeah.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
That's nice.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
She's nothing to do with me.
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
What was bugging Frank?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Brumby.
Shouldn't think so.
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
And you didn't know her last name?
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
What you having, Jack?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
No.
It would be. If they were still living.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Yep.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
Deadbeats all.
...they hold on to their money...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It is.
It's too...
Who?
He is?
With River Oaks?
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
What hard part?
What?
You...
You build it!
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
What?
What do you mean?
How many leads have we got?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
You haven't talked to him.
As an idea.
Yes.
No.
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
You're saying "me."
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
I'm sorry?
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
I didn't ask to be.
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
They stole...
They stole the phones.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
The cops?
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Will you excuse us please?
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
Just go to lunch.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Aaronow...
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
The people downtown said...
Could I...
...no...
...do you want to go downtown...?
Moss.
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
...you talk to Murray...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
And what if you don't close.
And fifty bucks a lead.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
You want something off the B list?
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
Mmm.
What are you trying to tell me?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
What?
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
That's right.
Fuck you, Dave...
"Always be closing..."
...yes...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
What is it?
I wanted to speak with you about...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Which...
Home cooking...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
I'm sorry...?
Kenilworth.
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Yeah.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Yes.
Gimlet.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
The check wasn't cashed?
I told you.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I...
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Why not?
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
They took some of the con...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
You closed him yesterday.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
Did you see my present for you?
On your pillow.
Just a few days.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
What took so long?
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
You're not my father!
Is Kay coming?
No.
The child cannot harm you.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
It was hard to have him killed.
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
But, you told me yourself...
It's the way Pop wanted it.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
How long does this go on?
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Goddamn it, where were you?
Mikey, I hoped...
They can come in now.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
It might show.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
Yeah, but don't worry.
What the hell are you talking about?
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
I'm going to the market.
Kay.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
On a plane back to Sicily.
Kay, I told you...
Not for a few years.
Very impressive.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I know.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What was that?
What makes you say that?
Fuck you.
So what did you think?
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
What're you talking about?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Something I can do for you?
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
I'm not married.
You're sure of that?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You and he are not doing things?
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
No.  Iced tea's fine.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
So we understand each other?
Not at the moment.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Run for what?
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
The Great War?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Just take off the fucking mask!
Should you be drinking in your condition?
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
Then the rumors are true?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Of course.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
What are you doing here?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Jesus ...
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I'm just here about my brother.
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
Get out of here, Ray --
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
What do you want from me?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
What's the matter?
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
That's a good one, Donny...
What does that mean -- ?
oh.
Why didn't you tell me?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
No...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Yeah ...
You okay -- ?
Yeah -
Hey, you want something to eat ?
I can handle it --
Me.
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
The family that steals together, deals together...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
You okay -- ?
Come here --
He give you an advance -- ?
Buy you a drink?
Mitch.
On account of Mitch?
I go with you --
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I do ... I cut "em...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
You okay -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
You remember Junie?
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
Not really -
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What're you doing? What about the car?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Jezuz Christ!
Stop! Stop!
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Where'd you find such creeps?
Yeah, yeah.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
He didn't call?
He's with his friends.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Oh shit.
No way! You're kiddin'!
Who's she talking to?
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
All right, then.
What are we gonna do up there?
What?
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
It's a way outta here.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Hi.
How you doin'?
How'd you know where to find me?
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Jesus.
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
How much money you got?
Some other guy?
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
Chuck, let's go.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
What class did you say that was?
Good, it was all right.
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Seven.
Yeah, can I help you?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Really?
Yes. Under two conditions.
That's right.
Of course.
--that?--
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Hey, how you doin'?
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Hello.
I've been busy.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
--And confuse him--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
He won't be a failure!
Where're you going?
Why there?
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
There is somebody...
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
What places?
Probably not.
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
You've never been out of Boston.
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Where were you?
You're kiddin' me.
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
Define that.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Gotta go with the belt there...
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
I know.
Which one did you take, Will?
That's what you want?
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Yeah?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
So you just want to use me and go?
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Well...
Where have you been?
Promise?
How the hell did you do that?
Why do we always stay here?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Want me to take a look?
Some, a little.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
No.
Yeah, I'm sure.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
What am I scared of?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
At least you have a mother.
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
I'd come back--
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Gallon or two?
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
No, I never. What?
You're right!
What's the matter?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
How about a lift, mister?
Naw--not much!
You people got a lotta nerve.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
That!
Know where we're a-goin'?
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
When?
Looks like you done it.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Then what, Tom?
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
You can have this for ten cents.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
Morning.
Really...? So what?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Never better.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Yes.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Yes.
Jesus Christ!
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
You never could have kept this from me.
Come on.
Yes.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Like a union?
Like a club. Work less, make more.
No harm no foul.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
Is that right?
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
What's it look like?
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Why not?
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Doesn't matter.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Enjoy the day.
Five years. My son was born here.
Everything under control?
You missed a button.
I don't care! We'd be together.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
What?
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Did you ask him to come visit?
You got everything you need?
I'll come.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
How's everything?
Hi.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
You've got to stop doing that?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
What if she doesn't want to go?
I don't understa-
Where does this go, Diane?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Of course not.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
She's an editor.
Can you drive?
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Oh yeah? What's that?
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Go fix the phones.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Yeah, mom?
I'm taking over a TV network.
What did we learn in school today?
Blow me.
Talk to me.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Two days.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah.
Kate, listen.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Yeah.
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Mr. Belford?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
Any questions?
What the hell was that all about?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Hello, operator services.
Purpose of visit?
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
So?
I don't know Brady.
Are you two okay?
You think she stands a chance?
An accident?
Because the lights are all out.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
How many people in the bus?
Outside.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
I can't sleep.
Double scoops?
You ready for some Ice Cream?
Come on Rachel!
Then we'll be safe?
Dad, what's going on?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Call me.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
I am. Ben Meeker.
This is starting to spook me.
It's over.
Sort of.
Shit!
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Sure, see you later.
Lies.
He can still watch.
Get him out of here!
You locked yourself in.
I'm scared.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Promise?
Ten minutes.
A man wouldn't do that...
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
You have the wrong feeling.
I found the car! He's here!
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Is Annie around?
Can we watch the monster movies?
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
I promise.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Yes.
Yes, she is.
I've given them his profile.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
You want to see some?
Well, let's do it.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Oh!
Uh...
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
But I'm seeing him.
We're actresses.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Hi, Dusty.
You're out looking here?
Yes, I do.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
No!  No...
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh!
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
She has all the cooking talent.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Yeah.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
No.
No.
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
I'm okay.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
How is everything?
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Okay, okay.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
He's not a loser at all!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Awwww...
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
What's the matter?
Good.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
Yeah.
Oh, no.
...in a really horrible way.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
I'm okay.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
Oh.  Oh.
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Yeah.
A reward...
Some museum director disappeared.
And?
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
You're ready now.
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
I know her by the Back.
...are they hard to get?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
Mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Yes, I did.
I can make you rich.
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
Why?
For a consideration.
Sir:
Shut up, Starling...
...what'm I looking at...?
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
I'm an orphan.
I said how's your baby...?
Of course, Commendatore...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
And?  Then?
How could you know?
Who does not?
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Is it necessary to know?
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
Thank you, Cordell.
...but will that satisfy you?
<u>Yes</u>.
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
Give me your gun...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Or clear your windshield with it.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
What're they on about?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
...no.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
I..
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
...yes...?

No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Man, she's losing it...
What are you gonna do about it?
No, they're not from Wendy.
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
I'm not a nai-ive little...
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--

Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
What are you doing?
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
S'okay....
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
How do you turn the fucker off?
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
We on tonight man?
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
What's that?
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
playfully shoves his hand away.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
Come on, sit up.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
sighs.
Can I go now?
My name is Gina!
is very angry.
You have to let me go!
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
gives her a sympathetic look.
looks startled at the outburst.
Mummy!
You're such an incredible woman.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Your insight is enlightening.
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
How much time off?
Yeah? You and who else?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Who's Allison?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
What?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Really, why's that?
A little? Try unbelievably.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
This game is over do you hear me?
Dreams?
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
You got a drinking problem or what?
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
The bathroom!  For two days?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Mister LaPlante...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
Bill, I got financial problems and...
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
You!
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
Me!
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
You never saw that picture, huh?
What picture?
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
Uh, er... I...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
What's the matter?
What is it?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
Ticket!  What's going on?
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
What's "cynical"?
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
So this really does the trick, eh?
Was that your dad?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Oh, great.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
You must value your independence.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
Uh huh.
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Honey --
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What?
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
What -- what are you doing?
What?
How large is your brood?
What for, dickweed?
Neil, do you mind?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
What did the thermometer say?
Is it a king or a queen?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Yes -- I think it is.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
What are we doing here?
Yes.
No.  What am I to do?
You can go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
Agreed.
Leaving?  For how long?
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
A lucky guess.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
You didn't answer my question.
I'm just trying to place you.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
It will end tonight.
We're holding the workers down below.
I don't think it is a duplication.
You stayed here again last night?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
You know it's not safe here for you.
I know.
Don't leave us, Conner.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
I guess so.
Talley.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
We're fucked.
There is no way out.
What are you talking about?
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
Who else is here?
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
Can you identify this man?
Keeps to himself, more like.
You have his address?
How did you get this number?
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
Yeah.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
I need to work out some stuff.
No one's coming.
Shh, they'll hear you!
I don't drink beer.
What do you want?
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
Go, Chief.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Sounds like you know the job.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Where's your gun?
Who are you?
These disks . . . where are they?
What happened?
We, who is we?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
You want to pay me?
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
And four children?
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
What's happening?
What did they say?
The high command? Our high command?
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
Your police are at the gate?
No.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
How so.
You think they will believe you?
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Where are we going, sir?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Excuse me.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
You could have asked for a favor.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Has Roger spoken yet?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
What's the matter?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
What?
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Let me go. Children get off.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
You have taken business class?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Twelve are dead.
How much beer?
Paul. Are you alright?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- bullshit --
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
This thing's going nowhere.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
And we get this money when?
-- closed.
Is she...alright?
I'm better than that.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
There's always exceptions.
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
This is the best we're gonna do.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
You didn't think to ask?
What?
First time for everything.
What?
House 2, Guests 0.
What is it??
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
The lockdown thing.
Don't know that it does.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
-- Eddie!!
Melissa...?
For the love of God....please...?
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
It looks delicious...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
H-how long will it take?
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
What's he doing daddy?
Don't be afraid!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
What's the matter?
To our family.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
So what are you saying?
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
A friend?
I think everything's ready.
Aubrey!
I think we should do it.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Maura.
Maura.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Your daughter's been taken.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
How long will it take!
Well what is it!
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
What will he do?  What does he want?
Then tell me what to do.
What?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Would you know this store again?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
I'm sorry.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yeah right.  Look ...
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Really?
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
But I said I was sorry....
My life is not some deal.  I...
Don't you just hate kids...
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Oh Hudson...
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
Why George, you big softie...
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Why does this have to be so hard...
The Dancing Dingus!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
...Hello?
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Hungry, anyway.
What a horrible little person.
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
I know that, Amy.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
...The people look like ants.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Your i --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
This I know, Benny.
I --
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
Yeah, but, buddy --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
Well, frankly, I...
No, sir.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Ya get the special?
...He's not noticing, Benny.
She's got other problems, of course...
...Her mother needs an operation...
Good morning, miss.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Alive?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
You don't believe in it?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
But it's so far away...
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I'm sorry...
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
I suppose so.  Yes.
Why did you come in here?
Well?
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Benjie!
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
That shirt?
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
That this was going to be a key party?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Hi dad.
Fine.
Hnnn.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
You want coffee or something?
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Well, we can talk about it.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
I saw you on your bike today.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
It's not a bother.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
That's right.
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
You have to follow me?
You're parents at that party?
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Nice kid.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Do it again.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Then change it.
How much closer would you say you were?
Duggar called him?
What about your shoulder?
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
What happened at that signing?
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
To do nothing.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
Fred Duggar?
That's not what he thinks.
What if someone finds out?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
I was her best friend.
Since grade school.
That's a long time.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
My arm!
She used some stupid code name.
I'm sorry?
No.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
You're not following procedure.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
We had feared we were the only ones...
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
We want no quarrel with him.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
More.
I didn't realise.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Don't Louis --
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Claudia! You did that?
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
It can't be -
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Yes.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
What danger?
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Did I hear a yes?
Come, you're going to feed now.
As did the one who made me.
I don't pretend to know.
Unless I make her one of us...
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
Lestat!
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
You're not lying to me, are you?
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
You loved Yvette...
Did he die in the fire?
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
That could break the machine.
Karaoke -- perfect.
Yes.
No.
Cancer in a box.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Yeah.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Ray, I can't...
Never do that again.
I don't know.
What?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Hey --
To a great weekend --
Well, I'm in school and --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Poor Cathy --
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then —- I'll not die —— I'll watch -— they shall not hurt you.
You are fortunate in your father.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
How do you know what my father thought - -
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
That's the kid.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Is this the place?
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Well?
Will you try to get some sleep?
What boat you sailing on?
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Uh-huh.
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Yes –– charge.
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
He's pretty young for that job.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
No, George, don't . . .
Say hello to New York for me.
Violet Bick!
It's important.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
When?
Those Rockefellers!
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Well, hello.
Eighteen.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Is it snowing?
Yeah, just started.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Where're you going?
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
You forgot something.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Yeah, it's her job.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Your dad must be really pissed.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
It's still there!
In here.
Not the drugstore!
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
You're too close.  Back off.
You stay here a minute.
Hey, come on....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
There is nothing to discuss.
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Why?
Door's locked.
Where's my day book?
Nothing, huh?
No.
That you were fired.
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
Martin, it could be anything.
When?
Can I go swimming?
Dad!  Dad!
Is that me?
Nope.
Maybe it's gone.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
Come on back up here!
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
What is it?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
You do everything your parents tell you?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Quiet!  Shhh!
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
It hasn't adjusted.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
It's Miller time!
Thank you.
Yeah.
You called, Doctor?
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Where are you going?
I know I can capture it.
No, we'll go through here.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
It's a shark's tooth!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
Somebody better get down there!
Go where?
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
They still seem nervous.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Sure am.
How come?
Told you you'd like it.
The space shuttle has landed!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Don't you dare.
No, South Georgia.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Look great, don't I?
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Thea....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Can I make sandwiches...?
Make a list.
Off....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
Whatever happens next.....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
We'll be there....
That hurt....
The fish.  Check it....
You can stay in my room.
I want you to give up your work....
I enjoy his company....
You just got here....
I don't know how....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I have my own little island.
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
I wish there was something I could do....
Feathers all over the place....
How many...?
The readings suck....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Money is money....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
You sure you've done this before?
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
What she's got.  Nine knots....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
I don't like the song.
I've got to get to her....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
Jake.
I told you....
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
I'm training to....
Yeah?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
What about that kid, Ross?
Maybe?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
Well .. I didn't know that ..
I'm asking it.
What about Citrine?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
And did they?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
I don't want them to arrest you.
What are you doing, Travis?
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Why?
Who sought the warrant?
Yeah, I guess I do.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
What was she like?
You think he still loves her?
You think John would like it?
How you doing on those shoes?
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Ugh!
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
No one has ever dumped me.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
He's asleep, right?
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Now what did you lose?
Oh no.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Hello?
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
We will be fine!
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Sure you're okay to drive this?
What --
You want...
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Yes.
Rod --
You are not allowed to act this way.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
How can I make your life better?
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Pardon me?
-- and I'll get 'em.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
What's going on, Jerry?
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
We can't just...
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
How much weight have you lost?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What did you say?
Udesky.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
We need to keep moving.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
He used to know me.
Why?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
Billy!
Resentful.
Are you looking for a problem?
I don't even know this woman.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Cancel that, Dieter.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
What?
What is?
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
You version of it.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Then this is our chance.
Come on!
Where's Kelly?
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
These formations.  They're dried --
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
That little black line?
Hold it down, Nick!
We have to send someone to look for him!
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
They smell.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
- - a gizzard - -
Come on, let's go.
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
Unpredictability....
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
He sends his apologies.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Yeah.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
Yeah, they hate me.
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Oh my God!
We gotta do something.
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Why did you do this?
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
You want to put in chain saws?
That's not true...
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
What are the charges?
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
How do we prove it?
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
You know how to use one of those?
Where do you live?
My assistants, I presume.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
Did you?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
Will you do me a favor then?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
A true friend would do it.
Did you see him?
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
I did not realize it was obligatory.
No, sir.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Was there something else?
I know.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you ...?
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
You don't believe that.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I've heard of it happening.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Eight -- and seven months.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
What makes you think so?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
This is filed incorrectly!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
It must have been terrifying?
What's that?
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
So do I.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
-- Yes.
I said yes, I see.
Why?
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
-- OK?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
-- Then you don't need me.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
You and I -- a relationship.
With Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
How do you know how bad it was?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
OK.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
You must be discouraged.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Someone's been doing all these things.
I can't follow you.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Has she talked with you since prison?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Think this is our guy?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Nobody's seen that.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
What do you have here, Billy?
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
What if she forgets?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
All it is is onions and gravy.
Then eat around it.
Is mom ever coming back?
See you in the morning light.
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Uh, huh?
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Why does he decide?
Where will my toys be?
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Yes, your honor.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
So do I.
Eight, almost nine years.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
No.
No.
I don't recall.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
No, but--
Look, Ted, all I--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
What are you going to do?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
You ever think about getting married again?
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
You heard anything yet?
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
We must go, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
But, I am in charge.
Goodbye, Kundun.
I have.
Did you receive the letter?
Who am I?
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
America, we shall see.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Pretend.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
We have.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
No.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
You're a beautiful woman.
Thank you.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
And what would he do come winter?
Is this a trick?
Was he a good man?
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
I got something on the screen.
Where?  Where?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Why are you here?  Really.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
You flew up here because your boss--
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Really--
Calm down.
Alright, Jack!
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He's floating.  Take it home.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
White perch.
You're sort of a rude person.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
What?
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
No.
No. He won't come after me.
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Yes sir.
Why not?
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I think so.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
A moth... How did you predict that?
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
The death of my father.
No. Tell me why.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Horses - and sheep...
How long did you live there?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
Later, listen, I'll -
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Yes. I'll tell you.
Are you alright?
The Ottawa are gone.
Mr Poe?
My letter...
There was no letter.
I see...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Dark haired...
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
What did you say?
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Wampum?
What is enough?
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
DeJesus!  A readout!
That's an order!
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
You did good...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
We're on backup air.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
The internal monitors read normal.
Excuse me, sir...
I'm going inside.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Still bothering you?
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Clear for pickup.
Are you sure you saw something?
Are you okay, Jonesy?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Hardly.
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
Well?
They were . . .
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
JD.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
All right, Dad.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
And the weed?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
I hope this is the right move.
You and me, Tom.
Tom, this is our case.
I'11 meet you in the car.
Yes?
And that does include the amp?
Tom, you're all heart.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
No, sir--
Because it's a job?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
No, sir. Not at all.
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
We're not running a dating service here.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
How's business?
That the word on our boy?
Skinny?
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
You know the popular version of how he left town.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
I'm not picking it up.
You look good--
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
If it's too late--
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
Dad--?
Homework?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Cliff--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
This girl is a friend of yours?
'57, 1 believe--
You go by your old house?
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Fellas.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Sam--
How 'bout the Sheriff?
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Okay? He's not here?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
Of course you can.
What's she singing about?
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
Your boy, there--
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Yeah?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
Sure.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
How come you don't took familiar?
Hello, L.A.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Who is he?
My life was too weird for her.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
That's Butterfield...
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Right.
You did.  Didn't you?
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
And are you afraid?
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
Harry.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
How did it go today?
He was the real thing, right?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Are you all right?
Harry-?
Valentin?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
What makes you so sure?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Shit.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
What for?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
I like to know why things happen.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Not much.
Hold on.
Where'd you learn that?
What?
That.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Or murdered, like Nix.
He deserved it.
Oh Jeez.
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
This is where we killed him.
I got to go.  I'm late.
Swann?  What are you doing?
And?
You could still help me do that.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
I'm thinking about it.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
Oh, what do you do with that?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Hello?
Oh, for her show?
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Thanks.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Mr. Harris?
Ok, well... I love you.
Is this a bad time?
What?
I guess she's busy.
Yeah.
Do you think it's done?
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Uh...sure...I...what?
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
Claire...
Must be a spare set.
...you wearing a watch, Father?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Yes.
He will.  He has great faith.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
I'll bet.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
What?!?!
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
We needed to know all we could.
When's your birthday?
What's the bible for?
You have to say that.
What about after?
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
He was trying to tell me something.
Hello?
It's useless...look at him.
That's not funny
What?
So what do I do?
Don't curse.
No I don't.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
What?
Coach...
Can I take your coat?
My mouth is kinda dry.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
What?
You ever been in love?
Just wanted to say good game.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
What's up, Sidra.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
I don't know.  A lot.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
What was that about?
What?
That was so weak.
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
She understands.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
What's up?
You want to go talk?
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Cheap date.
You forgot to be there.
Stay!
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Yup.
Oh yeah?
So...how's the knee?
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
So why'd you give up ball?
Cause I don't get it.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
What will this prove?
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Give it yourself.
Uh, your earring?
How was your game?
This is just about money, you know that.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
You want me to fuck off?
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
What's wrong?
Hello?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
My mother had breast cancer.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
uh...uh...What is it?
Yes.
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah.
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Yeah.
-- do you wanna cup?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
This is my job.
yeah, good, ok.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Eight o'clock?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
No, no.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
I'm sorry.
Well.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
It's ok --
I was listening --
What?
"The" cause of dullness in others --
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
Mmm.Hmm.
Yes.
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
Alright.  Thank you.
All it takes is one second?
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
She lived in Tarzana.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
And what did your parents do?
From '84 to '89.
...this close...
What name?  My name?
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Is Linda here?
He's in here --?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
Oh yeah.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
No.  I said that.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
I went out last night.
No.
Been drinkin' today?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Yes.
I won't.
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I'm drinking.
Come home soon after the show.
Love you too..
Yeah.
hey.
What about now?
I really don't know.
Yes you do.
No.
Yes.  What's your name?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
What does that mean?
You need to sober up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Phone number.
Mmm.Hmmm.
mmm.hmm.
Ok.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
I need this one.
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
Yes.
This happens....this is something that happens.
God smiled upon us.
No, M'lady.
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
Mother -- ?
May I speak with you?  Alone?
I wish to discuss your brother.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
More wine!!
Three days.
Now.  You were saying?
Aramis, this will never --
No!  Stop --
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Where are we?
It is also a place of burial.
Coming?
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
Do I look all right?
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
D'Artagnan!
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Athos, please...!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
Who came?
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
Your Majesty has had many women --
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
... The ball... Continue.
You've... memorized...?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Did they kill him?
Sire, I --
Did you know... about Raoul?
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
So what?
What do you think?
Find out for me.
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Did you read today's paper?
Who is it?
Yeah?
No...
And what did you do?
Tubbs, it's me.
Jesus, man...
Oh man...what happened?
I've got a better idea...
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
What about him?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
How much do you know?
No.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
You got the message Lecktor called...
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
It's the guard in the storeroom.
Have him peel the top label back.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
What's being photographed?
Tonic will be fine.
You worked out well.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
I'm very scared.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Absolutely,
I want to see Lecktor now.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
I want to see you, too.
Will?  You could come up here.
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
Yeah...
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
...after a while.
Huh?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Why should I tell you?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
Hi George!
Andy!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
They're having a laugh...
My hair is coming out.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Hi... am I late?
And all this will be for real?
You're not listening to me --
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Then your father's a wimp.
What?!?
Each show is worse than the next.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
It's so dirty.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Can I help you with something?
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Bob.
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
What?!
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
Sorry.
I got you.
All right --
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
How long?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
You could say that.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Of the Resistance.
Yes.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
I'm going to make the call.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
I'm not the One.
What?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
I just thought... you were a guy.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Go!
We can't leave him!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
What are you doing?
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
Where is it?
They're hacking his mind.
How?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
You're not far from Cypher.
Know where he is?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Yeah.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
You flew before?
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
What happened to you Flash?
I know but let's hear it anyway.
It's the truth, I swear.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Keep your mouth shut.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
What pipes?
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
You getting out too?
Oh Michael, look...
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
You're really crazy.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
What was it?
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Anything specific?
Did you?
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
You're intolerable today.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Sal!... fourteen street.
I know...I know.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Well...no.
Just keep him quiet.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Dinner?  Again?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
From the Korean War.
I don't like cake.
I haven't been the father to you that --
Yeah, but --
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Hello, Beautiful.
Thank you for coming.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
We have an arrangement now.
I'm not stepping anywhere --
A voice?
Me, too.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
No --
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Why?
I don't care.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
That's it?
Well, I guess he's found one.
Are you?
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Yeah, that's what he said.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Yah.
She knows you real self?
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
You love Allison, don't you?
How did you meet?
You think so?  How do you know?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
And I'll be a visitor.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I appreciate you --
Girlfriend?
Thank you.
...No.
Where are you going?
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
We know so little about each other --
Did I say that?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
No --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Not at all.
Good morning, Bill.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
Make an exception?
What do you mean?
Yes.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Okay.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I don't know.
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
And I don't give a shit.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Bill --
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
What are you talking about?
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
What were you going to say?
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Thank God.
Daddy, what's the matter?
You know each other?
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
What's the way?
So you're a one-girl guy?
78.
You don't know?
This isn't my room?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
Where'd you get it?
Do you remember me?
You think you can bargain with me?!
You know him?
I wasn't helping you for money.
Yeah?
Yeah, I hated it.
Somebody's come. Already.
No!
Neither do I.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Are you Teddy?
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
It's good.
I enjoy it.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
Things change.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Why are you here?
I don't think so.
Shut it, Teddy.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Doing...?
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
So...?
Make it 35.
How fast does that go?
Mojitas...?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Zero risk.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Is this the protective male talk?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
If they attack you...
Yeah.
What'd Neptune tell you?
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
What is going on...?!
What's the point?  It's going down.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
On the phone.
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Yeah.
And...?
And as an investment in the future...
Meaning...?
Equipment?
Lotta rich women back there...
I can tell, can't you?
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Tell her, Ratso.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
Gin's okay.
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Here. Don't even thank me.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Gonna be like money from home.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
Getchmis...?
Yeah.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
How's your hernia?
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
Yeah. How's Mom?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Stupid.
Just Erich.
Feeling all right?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
That doesn't seem so bad.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Work, work, work, that's all do
What lawyer?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Weird shit...?
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
And a right.
Look, I showed you my badge...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
You feel anything?
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Is there a switch?
He's special.
My God, what the hell are you...?
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Oh, no, you were-
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
It worked before...
You go first. I'll be right below you.
C'mon...
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
How long...?
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
What's it about?
It has no nobility.
I guess that means it's okay.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Well, I hope you like it.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Then who did?
Yes.
See, isn't this nice?
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
--not fair?
--cliff-hangers--
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
I hope you like it.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
No, I haven't.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
I'm glad you like it.
You don't know?
Yes, Paul.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
Maybe you can, Libby.
Hey, Pete.
If I can.
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Where is it?
How do you that.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
What was the top bid?
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
Do you know me?
No.  Should I?
- right..where is it?
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
And that's the only reason?
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
'Terrorists?'
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
I do.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
It's the transponder.
Left jacket pocket?
Let's start from the inside out.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
Come on!
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
Only four more cars.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Donít Jim.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
What about you?
We did what we had to do.
What are you going to do?
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Go ahead.
Theyíre dead.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
I donít think so.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Kittridge.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
It's quite out of the question.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
We'll see.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Jack.  Jack.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Try it again.
Itís not working.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
I won't pay for nothing.
Where you been?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
Hi.  Hi.
I have my eyes open.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
What killed him?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
Why you looking around so much?
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
That's it.
When you get engaged?
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Stop it!
I can't believe what is happening.
What did you do?
What did I do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
I'm telling you you can't.
But he wants me to come!
What are you talking about?
So. Where are we sitting?
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me go home.
You've gotta get outta here.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Will you marry me?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Then let's set the date.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
No.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
And we'll sell the house.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
It was a miracle.
No.
Hi, Loretta.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
He should pay.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
You don't know where Loretta is?
Yes?
Sure!
What happened?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Yes.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
My God, it's a mansion!
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
Look.
You got me.
She's got it.
How do you know she is a witch?
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Get away!
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
No one live there.
Yes ...
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
I've had worse.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
Ni!
They're nervous, sire.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Where?
Je...sus Christ!
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Old woman!
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
I'm getting better!
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
What is the capital of Assyria?
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
But, Mother ...
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Leaving the room.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Well, look er, I ...
What is your name, handsome knight?
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
How much?
Not bad, not bad.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
She'll get over it.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
I hope to go up next year.
Checked and locked, sir.
Louder, girl!
Mr Brown, sir --
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Convey her a message.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
It's so infernally cold in here.
Mother....
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Her Highness' Equerry.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
That can wait till the weekend.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I'm fine.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
I'm breaking no promises!
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
This is my good John Brown.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Erysipelas.
Where did you find it by the way?
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Unwell?
Has he been hurt?
We were expecting you to return by six.
From whom?
What do they want?
Maybe he's not dead.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Nick...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
It's twelve-thirty!
It is.
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Well?
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
SLIP-STREAM.
You're not coming, Alex.
Yes I am...
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
I'm okay.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
Give her a chance, will you?
But I'm not broke.
The Cowboy??
So what's the problem?
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
You're an understandin' fella.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Was anyone hurt?
But it said #12.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
No. Just the coffee.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"You're still here?"
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
And who are we auditioning for today?
Betty Elms.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
I just wanted to come here.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Could be unrelated.
Interesting.
Palmdale.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Hardly.
Not a coke or anything?
No.  I haven't seen any.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
Come on, it works.
So what do we do ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I'm not listening.
I'm listening.
How long till the room fills ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
I wanted to let his family know....
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
I don't get it.
Yeah a real shame.
What's next Walt ?
What the fuck are you talking about.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
So ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
No I am not.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
What was that ?
Look he figured it out !
Yes.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
I think we should follow him...
I'm talking to you asshole !
Why don't you shut up now.
You had to remind me?
Umm, where do you want this?
Do you still teach?
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
I don't think you're very polite.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
There's still a big spot on the floor.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
What??
What does that mean?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
She's beautiful.
My mother can't have any more kids.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I guess you have.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
Write me a poem?
What's it for?
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
A secret, I like that.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Oh...what's that?
There's plenty of fruit.
I think this place is just fine.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
Not exactly.
So what's wrong?
I mean...with your car.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
They're enormous, I know.
Is there milk in them already?
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
But Dad'll never go for it.
You're such a baby.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Can't you see it?
It's there.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Deceased.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Kinda like men.
Oh, how do you mean?
I had a good time tonight.
Did she ever see Vada?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Dad?
Feeding my fish.
Yes.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
What??
Why?
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Who's that?
Why?
He won't give it to me.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Big Ringo fan.
Are you married?
Have you ever tried any?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
The boys at school don't think I am.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What are you saving for?
I knew he wouldn't come.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
What?
Hey, where does it say that?
Who's that with your Dad?
Go???
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Like they do on TV?
For what?
I should look different.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
I honestly wish I could...
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
I've lost interest.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
And you believe that.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
But he sure can kiss.
He'll see right through it.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Uh, Kimmy...?
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
I've been calling for days!
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
W...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
The Big Hurt, huh?
What's up?
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Why would she come here...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
And to m...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
Winifred.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
You have to what?
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
What's wrong with her.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
His Word.
What?
They can come to the concert in the park.
How is she?
It's on National television, Barnett.
Not yet.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
How in the world did he get shot?
What's this?
Replacement party.
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
You got a place to stay?
We don't mess with accessories.
Next you'll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
When did you start singing?
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Do you like him?
Hello.
Hello.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Doesn't it have a name?
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
What...?  0h, yes.
You know who that is?
They said go see the chaplain.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
You know Bill is really mad at you.
We just got a gold record.
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Oh --
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
You want a ride into town?
You think I should take lessons?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Oh, why thank you.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
What kind of pies do you have?
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
By all means, knock yourself out.
Divine intervention.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
What?
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
You guys stay on your bellies.
Whose ratings were higher?
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Then was it worth it?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Says the United States of America.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
That's my opinion.
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
Are you all set?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Is that her real name?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Where' you goin'?
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
Boy - you hear me?!
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
Used to be. On the railroad.
No. You got the wrong idea.
Want to keep your job, boy?
What d'you want?
She done moved to Detroit.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
I been sendin' her money.
Okay.
People seen him 'round.
Guess I don't.
Thanks.
Where was your father born?
Well, he worked around.
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
I'm a teacher.
Went to college, huh?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
That's right.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
No, on the porch.
What?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Ain't your fault.
What's he like?
What?
What d'you mean?
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Uh-huh. Why?
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
I keep thinking about him.
Don't deny me, Duff.
You will.
Hi.
Yeah!
Don't do that!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
What d'you mean?
Where're you going to go?
How 'bout the key?
'See ya.
'You Will Anderson?
I asked you somethin', boy!
Couldn't get the words out before.
How you doin', boy?
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
I said, she's in great shape.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
They'll run you out.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Oh yeah?
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Come on, Will.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
What about her?
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
What's an A.I.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
I saw your girl yesterday.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
It's coming.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
What?
I know who you are.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Couple of months.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
A regular Fagan.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
I'll get the car.
He projects with neural implants.
I'm still going in.
Get up.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
What's that?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Who told!
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Cuuuute!
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Hi!
You need my help?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Do you remember high school?
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Thank you.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
You ruined the whole thing!
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
By name.
He sure is big, Jack...
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Coming...
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
It was okay.
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
I'm sorry...
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
Anything?
Okay, I guess.
Morning.
Yor dad picking the music again?
What's that?
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Do you still...see each other?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
It's been a long time.
Anything?
I'm serious.
I can't believe I just did that.
Then maybe you're ready.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
How is he?
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Wait a minute.  What about me?
No thanks.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
She left me.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Eleven.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
That's not true.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Sorry about that.
Yes...
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
I haven't decided.
Is that right?
That's right.
Where are you going?
Still loves you though.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Da Vinci?
Me?
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
The others?
Yes?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Topol.
That's right -- Topol.
Martin -- your customer.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
So I get the brownie?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
May I help you, sir?
So -- any messages?
Yes.
Why not?
Was it you?
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
How was she?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
M-m-m-ma'am?
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
On this ward?
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Mister McMurphy.
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
It's the questions she asks.
What?
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I refuse!
I said out!
I'm the coach!
Don't you have any clubs?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Right!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Oh, what's that?
Oh, what was that?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
You bet, Doc!
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Yeah, what's up?
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Hi.
Yeah!
I'm sure you will.
Now you talkin'.
Bet you ass...
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
What?
You ol' fucker!
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
She was your sister.
Of course not.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
So, what's the story with your friend?
--separate, in the evening..."
What?...
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Oh no.  Do you?
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
Amazing.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
To the foot doctor.
Does he love you?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Hi, Peter.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Beautiful place...
Been here long?
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
So, what's your point?
I don't know.  I don't think so.
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
Why don't you ask him?
It's still the new year...
Ah ha!...
You expecting somebody you know?
'Course he does.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Oh my God.  Where?
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
What about Peter?...
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Peter found him?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
He's a jerk.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
Oh.
It's siesta.
Giovanni.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
Right.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
She what?!
Where is she?
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's— 
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
What makes him so special?
I think we're O.K.
Which side are you with?
That was nice of you.
I don't know.
It's quite—  –nice.
What a fruitcake you are!
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
His— racket?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
What for?
It's true.
I've been sittin' in the church.
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
My hand.
Terry, you're bleeding.
Terry, for God's sake.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
You are like—
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
What are you going to do?
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
This is my business.
...walk?
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
I'm just resting my feet.
Better.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Take it easy now, Terry.
I— I musta counted wrong, boss, I—
So-so, Johnny.
Count this.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Go on, beat it!
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
Maybe I will— one of these days.
If I could get my hands on you...
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
I'm not sure...
Look!
Don't let them hear you.
Nothing is worth your life.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
Ahh, she will be yours.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
They are live ones?
We don't know of anything, Master...
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
He wants us.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Aannnnaahhnn.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Yes.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
You were his what, his box?
I'm not dressed.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Her phone's probably tapped.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
Whatta you think?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
Outside of that.
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
And what happened to Carl?
I have to qualify, is that it?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
All right, but...
Sure, Daniel.
You're gonna use a ram?
Wait.  You not Adele?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
How much for your company at chow?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Who's sitting here?
The fuck you talking about?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
How many was that?
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
We still talk, though.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
You know who this is?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
Don't leave me.
I don't have a problem with it.
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You believe that?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
You getting serious on me now?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
In the trunk?
I thought you guys were busted.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Have they got Midge up there?
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Really?
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
Can I do what?
What-- when?
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
No thanks.
"Hey, yourself."
He's pretty laid back, confident.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
I think he must've fell in.
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
Red...Strange?
Nervous?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
I'm out of ammo!
It's not getting any longer.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
What?...
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
They're waiting. Come on.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Charlie...
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Why wait?
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Yeah. Like that.
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Charlie. About last nights..
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
I just can't trust you anymore.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
What're you doing here?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
That's real big of you.
Just take a look at it. 
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Oh, God, Dion.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
It was Beth's idea.
What are you shooting for?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
Does everybody have to hear?
I'm excused.
I don't feel very festive.
Would they go over my girdle or under?
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Richard, take it easy.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Will you take of f your blouse?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
What's the matter?
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
I hear you moved into town.
What?
What do they do up there?
What's wrong?!
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
What do you mean?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
Jesus.
Thanks, Walter.
It could be parasites, an infection...
Fuck you.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
Maybe you should think about it.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Thanks for coming in.
Client of yours?
Little baby girl.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Continue.
Your... lover?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
They sabotaged me.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Who'd you get?
What's her name?
Rayisha.
How did they find out?
Get it?
Sure. It's fine.
What happens?
What kind of person is that?
Except... you were gay?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
What?
What kind of movies do they show there?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
No.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Objection!
We're going to draw blood.
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Right.
A homosexual encounter.
We won.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Not when I was in the Navy.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Let's continue.
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Bottle-count.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Why, what'd you hear?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
They're already dead. Get on board.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Possibly.
He used that?
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Frightening thought.
One is all?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
What're you doin'?
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Nice embellishment.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
Seal the cave?
Do you have any weapons?
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
But how long is a day?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
That way.
Any particular reason?
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Landon! Send a last signal.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Don't bother
We got off at the wrong stop.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
What?
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
ThatÕs a lie!
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
How so?
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Tell him to pull back!
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Sarge?
Yeah, what is it?
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
I was wrong.
Come on man!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Yeah.
I'll go with you.
I volunteered.
What are the heads?
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
I didn't like it.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
No thanks?
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Okay. You win.
Good evening, Miss.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
As I said before...
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Want a spike in it?
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Why not?
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
Us?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
Because you think your in love with me?
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
What are your rates?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
You mentioned information.
Sometimes.
Who told you my name?
It was lying where on the balcony?
Time for a little chat?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
That COULD BE TOLD.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Passkey?
That's not enough.
Recently, then.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
I've met her.
I'll know when I find it.
Was that about the right angle?
Where's the shell?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
No suicide.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
I believe you won decorations during the war.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
What's this?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
It's kind of you to see me.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Hello.
...break away completely from--
No.  I'd want to--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Why not stay?
In radio we're different.
I haven't really thought about it.
I might.
Let me see.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
The torture of small children--
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
We'll see what we can do.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
What's their program?
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
What's this?
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
You gotta tell me where she is.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
I say when it's over!
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Babes.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Good move.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
I need you to teach me.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
What?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Who cares!
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
We're not going.
What, Sergeant?
You saw what?
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
I think it's Hawkins.
Georgia.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
Yes.
Nice car.  Yours?
No.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
You're joking.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Why?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Do you ever... enjoy it?
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
This isn't a date.
Good.
I think it's exciting.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Vivian...
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Fuck off.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
But don't they have it in English?
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
I got tired of hating my father.
It was good.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Yes...
Doing what?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I pray for that.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
I got a dress.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Miss Vivian --
Excuse me?
Do you remember me?
Having a good time, Vivian?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Then why bother curing me?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Singed a bit, were you?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
What is it?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
What? What?
Sire.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
No one of consequence.
Kill me quickly.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
I accept.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
Guess what.
What?
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
What was I saying?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Do you think he'll take the job?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Heil you know who!
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
I mean in show business.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.
No.
I'm not the police.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
How early?
Of which morning?
No.
Cash.
Anyone at home?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
I don't know.
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
Yes?
Lila.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
No.
You want me to stay here?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
This is the old highway.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Sorry.
You can't go up there.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I'd like to.
You eat like a bird.
What are you running away from?
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Is there?
Oh?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Recluse. Kinder word.
Barefaced.
It isn't necessary.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Yes.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Yes.
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
You mean he doesn't work for you?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
That's it. You get it quick.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
How do you do.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
What were you dreaming about?
Yes.
No?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
Well, I do say it.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Meaning what?
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Call the Homicide Squad!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
What does that prove?
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
That's what I said.
Oh, is that what caused it?
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
To lunch.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
I've been dreaming about you.
What?
Well, I got to see her.
I know, Mother.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Well, some fiend might.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Open that door, damn you!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
She's watching the car again?
Let's go peep from the living room.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Of course.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
I am not being brutal to her!
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Rose, what are you doing up?
Is this ill right?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
What's the use, there ain't none.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Galley proof.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Yes, go on.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Well, you run on now.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
I don't want to go to the dentist.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
Indivisible and inseparable.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
What'd I say?
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
They... they shot me.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Hey...
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Nope.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
I... I think I can... clarify...
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
I'm gonna get beside him.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
Yoda spoke of another.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
I have felt him, my Master.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Hey!
Someone who loves you.
I...
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Proper?!
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
There it is!
The Emperor has been expecting you.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Oh. Well, yes.
Certainly not!
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
Janet!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Weiss.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
Hello.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Now I
Dealing
No no no, no no.
Who's Eddie?
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
...I don't know.
Looks quiet, y'know.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
...What?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Don't want weak legs.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
...Can't do it.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Why?
Christ.
Paulie!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
...It's very American.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
I don't like ya face.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
That's it, I'm broke.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
No -- Just me.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
What?
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
How old are ya?
Come July, twenty-five.
More like thirty.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
How am I doin'?
Wanna keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
It ain't your locker no more.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Yo, Paulie.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
...Sure.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
What?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
...I can't haul meat no more.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
So you decided to help him after all?
Sounds like singin'.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
No...
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
I didn't know who I could trust.
Where is he?
So where is it?
I got him on loan from Disney.
Maybe.  Why?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Safe?
I'll get it.
Wrong number?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
No better?
Have patience!
Romeo! Romeo!
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Juliet!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Why, may one ask?
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
This is important.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Well I don't!
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Hazard pay...
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Now, what did we steal?
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
You sure about this?
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
We'll double your price.
Do you have the material?
You first, Edvard.
Bad company...
In here...
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
There is one other thing...
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
Is that right?
Sorry I'm late...
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
It was at that.
A lot of people died.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
And what job is that?
You don't have to do this.
Do what?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
You were behind the door?
Business keeps you on the road?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
You have to stop doing that!
Gaelic.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
Doing well.  This is?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Damn.
I don't know what you're -
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
What makes you so sure?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
I don't know...
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
It's too late...
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
Has he?
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
Nothing happened?
He's not, he's...
And I'd take it out on him.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Uh, no...
Why would someone do that?
Dwayne.
Hello.
Uh...C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
A lot of men come in here?
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne please calm down!
What?
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
That's great Earl!
So someone did get away.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Invitation, please.
The band has been playing over an hour.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
I said get on your feet!
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
Carter, get off that stage!
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
How you doin'?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Who?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
He'll be back soon.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
It's a long story.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Slow down, baby.
What did you say?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
What is it?
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Well we're not friends.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Very nice.
Red Dragon.
Dancing?
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
I need your help.
Are you okay?
Baby Duck?
Ricky Tan?
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
This is pathetic.
Beach Boy.
Shortcut?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
Don't go there...
What?
Stool pigeon.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
You want more?
No, please, I don't --
I'm sorry, Lee.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
I could get promoted right out of here.
Jesus...what do you want?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
I'm talking about the girl.
Yo, Johnson...
You a cop or something?
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
Where do we find him?
I'm not running.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
"Make the shot."
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Maggie!
Look, he's running after her.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Yeah.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
And you are?
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
So?  Is that what you said to her?
You look... uh... You look fine.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Where did you disappear to?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
To who?  Are you asking me?
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
Why?
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
A harmless joke.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
You don't love me, is that it?
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Am I what they had in mind?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Nope.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
About what?
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Men never get this movie.
Hello.
What?
This is a photo of hair.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Who is this?
Why not?
I don't think I could really describe it.
Where's your mom?
Is he home right now?
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Hey, my plate is full.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Dad --
It's a spice rack.
It's never happening again. Right?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
So I can go.
Whose show was this on?
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Dad!
It's a sign.
It's only ten o'clock.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Everyone at work heard you.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Do you like it?
Is he there?
Mornin'.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
What do you mean -- sex equality?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
Was it expensive, the beer?
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
A meeting?
I waited up till midnight.
Ramón -- you can't.
Like what?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Will you be still?
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Well, if that's possible ...
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
You've got to help around the house!
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Did you see his hair color?
First rate, ain't it?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
You don't understand.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Nothing.
What do you want from me, Colette?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
How much time do you have?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
They would have killed you too.
Why?
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
Where to?
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Palmdale
I think on account of his nose.
He doesn't have one.
You want a hit?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
What the hell is that?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
By not disgracing her memory!
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Shoot him.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Yeah.  What about him?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
When is the deal going down?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
You think that's a good idea?
Just admit you're wrong.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Where's Bubba?
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Where are your men now?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
But, sir...I...I...
You writin' a book or somethin'?
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
We left them eighty-eights.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
White-walls?
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
Upham?
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
Good luck, Captain.
Goddamn it, sir...
Worked, didn't it?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about Talbot?
Uh, Captain...
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
Maybe.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Bits and pieces.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
You're welcome, John.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
There's always a bright side.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
No, sir.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Yes, Private.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Lingerie.
I usually like surprises.
Pardon me?
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
What's the profile?
Because he's guilty.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
That's not even a scam.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Hang in there, man.
Did you sleep with her?
No, you're not a guy.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I love you dad.
I won?
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Which they did.  Let me finish.
You should be.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
What happened to you?
Honey, it's not what you think.
That's right, work it out.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
So you're monumentally busy?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
What are these?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
So we can finally talk?
Have a good sleep.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
That's cool then.
Twisted?
Basic.  Hmmm.
You think so?
Okay, bye, I will.
Yes.
Are you comfortable?
I don't think so.
Then why are you shaking?
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
You need to study?
Yeah.
We decided...
It sounded like you did.
Then don't do it.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
PAIN!
No.
Very talented.
My car.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
Ooop, excuse me.
How you doin', brother?
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Luck.
You took my workers.
I just told you.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
I was just the accountant.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
We need to talk.
There will be generations because of what you did.
We know that, son.
I can do it, Captain.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
thought he was doing AA.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Cici. Who's this?
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
Cotton.
You could start with an apology.
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
It’s over, Cotton.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Fair enough.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
This is exactly what I don't want.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
She's got guards with her.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
Not good. How you doin?
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Dewey?
Just in case...
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
Sid, I'll come with you.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Her old boyfriend?
..it's really about family and tradition...
She's not here right now.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
Do you want to die?
I hate scary movies.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Yeah.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
What do you know about trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
The killer called her.
I can see nothing's changed.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Why would the police come to you?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
Jennifer needs me.
You're not a detective.
Do you want us to come with you?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Who's this?
But you know my favorite name?
It is in my script.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
Who is this?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
Owwww...
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Duh... that's quick.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Nope.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Billy? What the...
What are you doing here?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
It's been a year since she died.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
Are you serious?
Who did you call?
Stop it!
What number are you trying to reach?
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Popcorn.
You getting scared?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Michael... Michael Myers.
You tricked me...
What?
No, not yet.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Did you reach my Dad?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Afraid not.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
What is it? Where's Casey?
Casey! Casey!
What? What?
What's the delay?
Just stay back.
Off the record. No cameras.
Has his story changed?
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
No you didn't.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Do you believe this shit?
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Whatever. Just hurry.
Take a message.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
No way.
I thought you dumped her for me.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
Give it to me.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
What do you think?
So what?  This victim...
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
What the hell's going on?
Give me the gun.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Not here.
No one yet.
It's a bucket of vomit.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
It's my wife.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
No witnesses of any kind?
Nothing.
What the fuck is that?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
And you don't?
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
No.
This is a waste of time.
What are you going to say?
I'm fine.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
You knew I'd say yes.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
What in...?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
You all right, Ethan?
Oh...
He just couldn't wait...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Think she means for us to follow?
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Not far from it...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
They never find that girl.
Finish your breakfast...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
You crazy?
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
What are you doing?
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
I really hate to bother him, but...
Hello.  Can I help you?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
What?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
You are a gentleman.
Follow that boat!
What is the chief part?
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
On my mother's side the Ardens
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
And his ears.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter…Almost finished?
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
So what do we do?
How?
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Romeo.
Kit
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
"Out."
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
God bless you!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
When the Queen commands it.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Your mother, and your father
Your Majesty.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
And--?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
Will!
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
My lady!
If they find you here they will kill you.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Oh, do not go
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
You flatter, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
But what of Lord Wessex?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
About what?
Alex, I don't have the time --
You call them if you want.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
Is this necessary?
You're not eating.
Your friends.
Where do you think you'll go?
Cover it?
Is this being recorded?
Well, then?
I don't know them.
That's it, then.
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Who was it?
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
I wonder how he did it?
What are you doing?
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
I thought we all were.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
What's he doing here?
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
We have to talk.
Expecting anyone?
You'll wait in the hall?
What?
No, nothing, sorry.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
I see.
Just get on with it, Alex.
What?
It wasn't like that.
Eh --
You must be Hugo.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
That sounds fine.
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Yes, but... I thought...
That's George.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- is that right?
I know.
You're late, George.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
-- What?
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Her?
No.
Then it's not your problem.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
I am not!
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Right.
You promised you'd do the show.
I'd cut it...
Did Lester know about him?
George... how about Felicia?
Baby...
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- what?
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
No you didn't.
Sammy's?
What are you looking at?
-- where'd you go?
Mmmm --
What's wrong?
What's that supposed to mean?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- took a bus.
That's too bad.
There were some shots.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
We live together now.
I already said hello.
Yeah, baby.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Your advice!
When?
When is that, George?
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
What do you wanna know for?
What? What? What? What? What?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Did you?
Stop it.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
No?
You need a cut.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
Thank you.
They're not?
What about, tonight?
This really ought to be layered...
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Why, why do you think that is?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Me!
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
Awww --
I'll call you back...
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Who are they?
That's right.
See you later.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
No... how long did you say?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Dad?
Tony.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
I don't know.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Is Tony one of your animals?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
And, er... where are they now?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
Yes.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Jack...
I don't know.
Yes...
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Very nice to meet you.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Right there.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Can I tell you kids something?
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Mom-!
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Huh?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
Do I need one?
I don't get you.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Yeah... sure.
What is it?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
It could have been anything, Marty.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Perhaps.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
Yes, Mary?
SING!
How come?  Sister?
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
Oh my! 
What is it, Betty?
Where did that come from?
Is this... choir practice?
I know.  It's ancient.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Wet behind the ears.
JUST SING!
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
She won't?  Why not?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Goddamn it!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
Are you leaving us?
Run!  Take off!
It's true!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
The reason?
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
You mean black people?
What's a concubine?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
Is this all the food I get?
My what?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
A vote?
But -- why?
Oh?
So I don't shop.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
Like what?
I just need a few more weeks,
Me too.
What?
Hail, Mary.
A nun?
It didn't work, Vince.
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
Neither did you!
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
However, we can also pray for other things.
He's decent.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
What the hell are you doing?
... Brom Bones...
Bring Young Masbath here.
Your superiors are two days away!
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
The Widow Windsor.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
I manage fine alone.
It's spectacular.
Father said witches live there.
What is it?
We are leaving.
We should go.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Climb up!
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
To avenge his father, and the others.
I apologize if I worried you.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
I... I can't do this.
No.  She has gone out.
Where?
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
No.
Thank ye.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
All right then.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Thank ye.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
Well, I guess it's all good.
French-fried potaters.
What you got in there, warshing?
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
What?
Leave.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
I hate you!
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
I want to be baptized.
Why? Hi, Karl.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
What's you last name?
Why'd you live there?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Two people.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
What do you mean?
Pull on your works. Your privates.
I don't reckon I know.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Why?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
Is that right?
It was fun, anyhow.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
I've got a feelin' today.
Did Karl go to bed?
I know he does.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
I'm ye boy.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Thank ye.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Yes sir.
No thank you.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
I'd love to.
What's the difference?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
A photographer ...
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
She probably died.
Yeah, probably.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Still, you can't just write her off.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
You mean Rashid?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Not a one.
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
In Manhattan?
The what?
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Two or three nights.
Are you going to be all right?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
I don't have much time. 
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
You work too hard, you know that?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
And started to run.
That money is my whole future.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
Well, what then, sergeant?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
No spare.
I believe so.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Bye.
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
What did he say?
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
Of course I am.
But suppose it doesn't?
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Yeah - where were you?
With you.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
You'd better go fix it.
Fight it.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
And I'm not even pretty.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
That's right.
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Jerry - there's another problem.
Like right after the ceremony.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
That's some nerve!
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Joe -
Shut up and keep packing.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Did you hear that?
What'll I tell him?
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
And you've got cold feet.
I'm fine.
What's the surprise?
When?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Here you are, Sugar.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
No!
Brand new.
I was it.
What's the big idea?
Yes, I'm holding on.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Why?
About that roadhouse -
Yes, Osgood?
We can have it altered.
And I can never have children.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Bingo?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
You know - I play tenor sax.
What's in Florida?
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Happy days.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Saxophone player?
Not very likely.
Your face is familiar.
Your view of what?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
One of whom?
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Who's going to raid a funeral?
I never join nothin'.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Why?
I cut myself shaving.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Christ, Amy.
Are you sure you’re okay?
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
She did?
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
I’ll just check into a hotel.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Shrink, actually.
So, what’s your point?
Not for a dog.
Mission accomplished.
No, count it, anyway.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
I love that you’re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
It’s hard to explain.
Come on.
And that’s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
Like fifteen.
You knew?
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
What about Sounder?
And so you did your job, right?
No, Miss Johnson...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
But, Charlie --
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
Well, looka here...
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
Goodnight, Daddy...
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
You hurt, Daddy!?
What's that, son?
What's your daddy's name?
When's that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
Did you see Daddy?
Good night, Mama...
Did you find your father?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Whatcha got there?
How's the weather out there?
There, you see?
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Doggy.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
About what?
What is this?
What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
What?
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
Your behind?
Mrphmmmph!!!
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Help yourself prickfuck!
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
May I?
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Oh my God...
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Shiteater-
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Who's my cream puff?
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Oh yeah...
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
I think I can handle it.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Look at this...Jesus.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
I don't know what we're facing.
Are you ready?
Taylor?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
Take this flare.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
But how are you going to escape?
So close...
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
What kind of man?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Nope.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
I gotta survive.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
What about bowling?
He's the guy Buzz.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Uh...over easy.
Buzz Fazeli.
What did you do to Buzz?
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
No!
You know who I am?
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
What ever happened to just bowling?
After we eat, Dad.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Where can I find him?
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
This is a vicious cycle.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Where did your brother escape from?
What does he do?
Do I want you?
No, I'm fascinated.
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
Sheila, please.
You got any broken bones?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
Why did you come back?
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Fletcher, get away from there...
It's burning...
How big is this spacecraft?
There's heat coming the door.
But she's --
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Direction's east coming!
That's our reserve air.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Storm?  What storm?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Maybe older --
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
Wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
Can you open that panel?
Yes, sir.
Gimme a report, I want --
A half a mile long?
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
That's quite a secret.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
Wait -- down where?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
Yeah, it was awful.
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You, me and Harry?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
You get it straightened out?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You don't believe me.
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
How do you spell it?
What's that?
It's getting cold.
How do you feel about snakes?
You know what I mean.
That's when you went in the sphere.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
Beth --
Beth!
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
C'mon --
Top shelf, is it?
What?
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
C'mon.
What is that?  That noise?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
But why would she -- ?
What is it?
I don't think so.
Push her, c'mon.
Gimme a second --
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
Nine hundred feet to surface.
There is one possibility.
What is it, Harry?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
What'd you say?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
You've heard of me?
Try this one.
Well, he's polite.
What kind of a crash was it?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
The Empire must have gotten here first.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
How can you store an energy field within you?
They use the Bogan Force.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
What is it?
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
Where are you taking us now anyway?
This isn't going to work.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Is he afraid of the water?
No need, everything's under control.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
And you?
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
It's what I deserve.
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Sir, no, sir.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
I don't believe it !
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Are you alright ?
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
WHERE IS IT ?
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
I'm sorry, Carmen.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I don't want everyone to see.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
How do I know if this is love ?
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
He's nothing like you.
I love you, Carmen.
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
All bands.
Oh, my, what's that ?
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
No, sir.
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
May I ask Why?
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Then you acted properly, of course.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
You bringing your new friend?
Go you Huskies?
Who?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
You like my play.
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
As the Old Mill goes around...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
You'd know better'n me.
<u>How</u>...?
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
What happened?
Cast stood me up.
"Room Service!"
The other side.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Oh <u>okay</u>.
I can't get it to come out right.
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
You know what else a man can do?
Yeah, you?
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
We did...?
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
No.  Don't tell me that.
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Aren't you ever in school?
I think he's moved...
Get him on the phone.
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
I, actually yes.
But not that <u>way</u>...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I'll put the, in your r...
Yes.
Who got their heads cut?
Why?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
I'm looking for the writer.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
Not now.
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
I know the feeling.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Why?
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
What is that...?
He's got a gift for fiction.
She wasn't in...you were al...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
I'd rather be with Mommy.
Well, not exactly s...
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
Great.  Big ears, too?
Then have a donut --
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
What honey?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Where Ben?
Okay.  These are good.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
So why did y...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
You feeling all right?
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
My boss.
Look, you've never liked me...
So.  Hopeful.
I really look like shit.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Looks nice enough to m...
Are we.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
That's not wh...
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
I lost him.  I was panicked.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
She's not gonna die.
I told her I loved her.
Restless.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
What?
Hey. What's up?
There are some rumors...
He was in a concentration camp?
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
What are you going to do?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Ready for tomorrow?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Reconceive.
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Hey, Mikey!
Say, Ni...
Ni...
Fuck me hard!
Again!
Any books you like to read for fun?
I hate reading.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Hello?
Hello, is this Pam?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
I believe it.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Anything I might know about?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Prnceton.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering…Is the documentary almost finished?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Well get someone down there!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
So, what are we looking at White?
What do you mean?
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Dissent?
We can't--it's power driven!
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
At his office in the Capitol.
Where is this...thing?
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
My seven body orifices????
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
General Schmuck?
You aren't sure!
That's a very wise deduction, General.
This is General Ripper speaking.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Plan-R????
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
I guess so.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Right.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
I presume the planes are armed?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Some kind of signaling.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Check target approach.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
He's dead.
How do you know he's dead?
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
Recall what mistake?
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Are you sure?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Forget it.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Yeah.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Yup.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
That sounds so depressing.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, I'm not worried.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Guess not.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Come on.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
I will.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Whoa!
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
You could do it.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Can you tell me what happened?
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
You lied to me.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
Just go home, alright?
This is my home.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Is that Bee-Bee?
Oh! Trim it!
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
What?
Nothing.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Come on.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Go.
You really suck, you know that?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Well, not exactly.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
I hope you're happy!
Hey!
Oh!
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
New York, huh?
You do not!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
About what?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Don't do that.
Your manager?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Holy shit.
I'm in, too.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
And they get caught!
No.
She thinks you went to the police.
Hi, Jack.
Spit from your dad?
Let me explain something...
Madonna.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Don't use big bills!
Kim-Lo?
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Hello?
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Really...
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
Your help.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Give me your coat.
Let it ride for a while.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
I've been hoping to run into you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
You'll be waiting for me?
O.K.  Where's the cash?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
So do I.
Oh, you --
Who's Norma?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Why not?
Hello, Betty.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
You bet.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
What assistant?
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I wouldn't know.
It is not.  Get out.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Of course it is.
What month?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You can stay here.
You'll like it here.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Just a scene I cut out.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
What's the matter with you?
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Goodbye.  Norma.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Is that so!
Uh-huh?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
You made her a star?
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
What is the scene? Where am I?
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
I think I'd better keep it.
At last. Ultimate Power.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Don't leave me.
When can I see, you again ?
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
What's that?
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
They think I have a concussion.
Nurse!
No!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
You vicious--
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Hey, where you going?
I've got things to do.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Oh, no thanks.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
I'd rather not talk about it.
How'd you do that?
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
What can I do for you?
No, MR. Danvers.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Goodbye...
Brad.
Brad?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
The kid needs a man to show him --
You look wonderful.
You're welcome...??
It sure is.
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
No, thanks.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
What are you doing?
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Nope, but --
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
A television set?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
Uh...
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
When?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Is this whitemail?
What will it get me?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Who's the other woman?
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
What about me?
What about you?
Why do I have to do this?
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
I don't kiss.
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Small potatoes.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
Where did it come from?
Anybody been hurt?
Hostages?
Where were you?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
It's true. It's true.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Everything on it?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
A parka.
Artemis? Do you read me?
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
I asked the right question.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Where?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
I've never been in a place like this before.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
What about here?
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
But he's never there.
But why the hair?
Whoa. . .
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
We'll all fry.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
What I need this for?
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
I'm not going anywhere.
But . . . how could you beat him?
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
Mom...
Do you know where you're headed?
Your bookie?
Are there any more at home like you?
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Stop him, Clark!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Oh.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
You're just jealous.
You and your real estate.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
I read the article.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
Don't let me down.
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
I mean the other one!
Then -
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Thirty-five.
I gave him this new face.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
Which one?
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Why are you telling me this?
They just finished supper.
Yes.
That's right.
What do you mean?
He knows that?  Billy?
Yes.  He does.
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
What do you think?
You hate it.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
We've only got honey.
How was it?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Nicole!
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
That's right.
Yes.
I don't want you to lie.
Why?
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Is this it?
Perfect.
I'm in a car wash.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Yes.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
What time in the morning was this?
You remember that much?
What do you remember about the accident?
Very slick.
The door needs a lock.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Nothing.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Who said Sidney?
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
Get Steve back his job...please...
He means that much to you...?
Don't go wild, Sidney.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Bribing me again?
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
And where was his wife?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
But what?
The renting agent and the tailor.
What's the matter?
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
You're talking very fast.
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
You haven't told him yet...
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
What chip?
Why?
Everything.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Pain causes it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Alriight!!  My man!
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
I'll deal with the police.
Drive for a minute.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I know!
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
Where do you stand on all this?
On Furtwängler.
Eating is eating... and...
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Five minutes.
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Yeah.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You do shorthand and typing?
Of course.
What's not right?
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Sure.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
What telegram?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Like this bandleader.
First oboe.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Yes, Chuck?
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
You can't to that...
I hate the beige one.
And you're from the future too?
What's he like?
Kyle?
Is this enough?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
Did you play recently?
What <u>is</u> your problem?
There's got to be a flashlight.
What's C.R.S.?
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Okay.
Take the picture out.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
Who are "they?"
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
Where'd you get that... ?
Hey there, Nickie.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
For you.
Call that number.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
It's a profound life experience.
I said I would...
Tell me where we're going.
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's them.  They did this.
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
What's the trouble?
What's this about?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
Look, where is he?!
Nicholas...
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
No.
What did it smell like?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
What happened after you smelled it?
What'll happen to us, Nell?
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Why would we --
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
David.
That's so sad.
I don't know what to think anymore.
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
No.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
I wouldn't talk.
Oh really?  Where you from?
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Yeah?
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
What more is there.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
She didn't write to me, did she.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
What d'you say, Elaine?
Really.
Why did you come here?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Modelling.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Right.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Why not.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
On what.  What makes you so certain.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
It didn't discourage you, though.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Get seven years, did you?
I guess you're just habitual.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Where's Big Sur?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
All of what?
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Ian?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Yeah?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Yeah, that's right.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Which kind?
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
So what.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Where is he, then?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
You must know Ian.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
You're an enthusiast.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Right! Strictly business.
...Were you in the service, Ed?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...What kind of man *are* you?
...What's so damn strange about that?
...OK.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
OK, how did you know?
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Not guilty, your honor...
Sure you don't need one?
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Ed, how're you holding up?
Uh-huh.
...You sure, Eddie?
Huh?
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
What'd he say?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Lieutenant --
I think I should come with you.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
Come back and get me.
Where is that?
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
How about lunch?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I don't know.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
Genetic damage?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
Then it won't go after the others?
We have to try and draw it off!
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Today.
It's the busy season.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
Close up?
Why would we--
What music?
He doesn't care.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
Certainly a nomination.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
Why not?
Sure she would.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Marlon--
Sorry, I'm way behind.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
How did it go today?
I won't be late.
Oh, God.
What do I do?
There's been an accident, Truman.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
There's no one here.
--How do you know about that?
Poopy day?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
This man's still alive.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
What's that?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Those people were already dead.
Before the bomb went off?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
What killed those men?
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
Negotiating with whom?
You've been using me --
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
I'm on the roof.
What's wrong, Scully?
No you didn't.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Why?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
You're... quitting?
No.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I'd been told as much.
You said you weren't coming?
How was it contracted?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
-- of what exactly?!
Yeah, well they may this one.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Where'd they go?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
I have. I did. It's done.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I can't go any farther.
Well, call General McAddie.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Where's Scully?
What is it?
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Let me out. Stop the car.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
A pocketful of rye...
Did we go sailing?
Yes mother.
...give a kiss to Edward.
It doesn't matter...
They're hungry.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Nervous?
Any psychiatric medication?
Is she alright?
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
Right here.
Den leuten.
Ja, ja, ja.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
No.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Do I...
Oh, that was many years ago.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
...again.
Harry.
Oh, well.
...anyway?
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
Joseph Harbin...
They are - private - letters.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Holly Martins.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...in the morning.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
It wouldn't work.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Calloway!
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
Of course.
Very good, sir.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Who?
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Hello, Harry.
Listen...
And - Anna...
You can get somebody else...
Why not?
...your address?
The Roumanian?
Are you mad?
Vinkel.
Thank you.
Speak English?
Yes.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Oh, you did.
Something wrong.
That's all you meant?
Where are you staying?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
One or two kilometers.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
What!
She is gone!
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
No one follows that midrash.
They only kill them when they love them?
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Who the fuck are you?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Why no silencer?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
Your father??
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Why?
That's stupid.
V'asitem...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Who's Eichmann?
How would you kill him?
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
A forty-five.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
You do it on the inside....
Daniel Balint.
That's meat.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Get out of here....
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
JTS...?
Who'd you kill?
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
"Do chickens give milk?"
Fund-raising??
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
We tested the new bomb.
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Does he know?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
Congratulations, Enzo.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Dollars.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Where did you get that?
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
And where did you say you were from?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
I dove 315 feet!
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
It's okay.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
No!  I would never cheat you.
You look adorable.
Then, tell me a story.
No... tell me.
I'm being a pain, huh?
Absolutely positive.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
It's my apartment.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Will he understand Spanish?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
What!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Yes Esther.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Keep going.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
I wasn't too over the top?
Is he in love with you?
What about me?
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
See you tomorrow —-
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Show business?
That's right, of course.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
It was you, Galbraith!
Tormented -- ? Why?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Makes no difference. Get him out!
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
What! You can't be --
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Disney! How inter...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
Then find another way.
What about your friendly cop?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
What sort have you got?
Yeah.
What about an untrained pup, white...
Where is the Austrian?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Good.
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
I hope it’s not too significant.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Vous êtes Français?
You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
What is it?
What are you talking about?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Should I be?
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
How’s the boy doing?
Los Angeles?
I know his work better than I know him.
Alors?
I can only tell you what he told us...
When they realise I’m missing...
I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
Good.
Sound the retreat...
I don't remember.  Maybe.
And?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
No, I... I held it up to...
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
God defeated the English, not me.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
The voice was in your cell?
What did it tell you?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Thanks be to God.
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
I'm... I'm not the king...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
Your majesty, I really think you...
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
The wind will be against us...
Not yet.
This is no good!
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
No.
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
So your memory's coming back?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Yes, my lord.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
Who is this "he"?
Hello.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Really?
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
When's your baby due?
Let me see this.
I'll be fine.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
What's this about?
They bombed us, we're off the air.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Yes, but what good did it do?
Jehuda, give me something to do.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Sorry, I don't remember.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
Like it were a piano?
No, it was a table.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
What's he say?
Yes, why not.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
No.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You mean in signs?
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
She wants to see what you can do.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
Play a gig.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
How 'bout a handkerchief?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
You're late.  Where you been?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Which one?
Mottola.
Who's got the contract?
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
I'll take him anyway.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
Henry.
Looks like he's sulking.
I guess I left it in my room.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
You move right along, don't ya.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
I feel lucky tonight.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
We missed him.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Yes.  He admitted it.
You know how they are... sex...
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Any luck?
What?
How are you?
What are you talking about?
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
Yes.
What would your mother say to that?
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
I never saw him before.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
I'm asking you.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
No.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Rosebreen.
What're you doing here?
I see.
No.
You did!
Do you think that Wynant did it?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
I can't! I haven't got it!
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
They'll want more than your word for that.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
What am I?  The fall guy?
You got types?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
What hit me?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
I'd like to see you work.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I don't know.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
Looks like a hold-up!
You wouldn't be a widow long.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
What things made you so sure?
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Who do you think did it?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
I know I left them there.
I'm sorry...  but...
I just wanted to tell you...
I'm fired.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
They stopped.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
For climbing.
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
What about it?
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
It's a combat action.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
What about Jaeger?
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
You think?
Steady it out!
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
I heard it click.
There's a way.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
X marks the spot.
If they land--
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Forget Wes.
What if he's not?
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
Sure.
What do you figure it is?
What do you make of them?
Shi'ites, I think.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
...Wes...?
Which way do we go!?
How do we do that?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
I don't know.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
He says it's a box.
Jaeger?
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
I think he wants something to drink.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Now.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
no...no, no.
THX!
Good Lord!
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
I'm leaving.
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
I knew him.
Remember this...?
Where's LUH?
No...no you're wrong.
Yes.
Yes.
May I help you?
Just do it.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
What was-? Why...?
Now wait just a fucking-
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Yep.
Look, it's a longshot...
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Ex-girlfriend?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Something round, two wires ...
"Punks", huh?
No... No more killing.
Alex, please-
Drop it.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
You okay?
A what?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Well, have you found it?
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
No.
Constantinople?
Yes!
Just dull.
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Who?
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Thank you.
Thank you, Baron.
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Yes...?
Oh!
That's too dark.
Beautiful specimen.
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
The same thing.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Precisely.
Like that?
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Adolph J. Giron.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
It could have been marvelous ...
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Yes, my bag!
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Holy shit.
Don't drop it Rose.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
You told me to change.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
How you two doin'?
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
It is that simple.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
May I cut in, miss?
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
You jump, I jump, right?
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Never let go.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?
Just tell us what you can --
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Oh--a hundred times--
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Where'd you get it?
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Could I see you a minute?
Yes--are you?
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Like her paint job?
So you washed it off!
Good-by!
Never eat before the show.
Brett is the name.
Well, I can't.
Sooner it you like.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
But--
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
I could see you were pining away--
Nix, the law!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Partners, ain't we?
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Well, let's hear the poem--
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
What for?
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
I wish I could.
Not because of Ned.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
There you are, sir.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Sure, Sis.
I'm all right.
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
Oh, my God...
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Here, Doc.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Awful lot of money.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Just doesn't, that's all.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
And I don't even know your full name.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Wyatt!  My God...
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
'Least you admit it.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
There they are.  No herd though.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Yeah?
That thunder's sure somethin'.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
They're carrying guns in town.
Virgil?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Sir Elliot.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
What about the uranium?
Shhhhh...
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
... Do you have a gun?
This has got to be a mistake.
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Sometimes you just have to -
... Yes?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
Sorry I'm late -
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
You won't get away with this!
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
Fueled and waiting.
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Junior spends time with his child.
Yes.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
It is just a regular card.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Your feet are cold.
I'm worn out.
Since this morning.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Good morning.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Hattie is a different person now.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
Did you have your child at home?
Where is Skip?
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Can I bring some toys?
What are you doing over there?
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
THAT is Sid!
Trouble?!  Where?!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
Spaceship.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Shhhhhhh!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
That ain't no happy child.
Will you quit moving around?!
You are a liar!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
This is ludicrous.
W-w-w-we?
Woody!  Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll put your clothes here.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
He made that. In his off hours.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Go away.
Finn -
I've got a present for you...
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Surely she is older?
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Victoria -
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
I don't know what you mean.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
What?  What is it?
How much?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
Don't bother.
I was just waiting for the right time.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
Did you tell Dad?
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
You can't make me.
Yes.
Yes.
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
Private?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
What do we do?
I'll put this in the back.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
Madrigal's alive.
What?
Does this offer include my partner?
Noriega is a criminal.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any idea how much?
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Hello.
Who do we interface with on their side?
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
Twenty thousand.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
Thanks.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Diane.
Because it's illegal.
Holding hands?
No, not holding hands.
Can I see you again?
Yes.
Sixteen next month.
It's an interesting theory.
Now?
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
There's no need.
That's nice.
Thanks, Mark.
But try too hard --
Who wrote it?
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Did he -- you know?
What?
God, you're sick.
That's tough.
Are you serious?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
That's fair enough.
So what's it going to be?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Can we have it quiet?
You caught me on my way to the shower.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Ah, Captain?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Life is not a dream.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
You must allow us to act.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
How do you know?
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
Hmmm?
Spock... the booster rockets.
What are you doing?
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...

Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Spock?
I don't understand...
You invented Space Paranoids?
Did he say why?
What for?
For what?
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
That all you can say?
Oh. Anything else?
For sure...
This town's full o' live ones.
Yes!
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Flynn?
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
Cute.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
That was uncalled-for.
Well I want to communicate --
Dumont!
You're alive!
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
What about our friend - Sark?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Feel what? You okay?
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
You think we can make it there?
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
You bitch.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Where are you going?
Okay, Dad.
Harry?  HARRY?!
Copy that.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
She's still at my house.						*
So, it was your first time.
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
That's fabulous Harry.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
What?
Louder please.
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
Natasha?
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
I understand.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
And you chased one?
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
Hello, Alabama.
Gotten your mail yet?
Let me speak to Clarence.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Tell him to look through it.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Thanks a lot.
Sonny kicks ass.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
Who?
My pimp.
Is he black?
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Is this a joke?
I think what you did...
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
So you do eat pussy!
Clarence?
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Clarence sent a letter?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
I know.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Clarence...
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Really?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
He wants to talk ya.
I can see what you mean.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
What makes you think I could do that?
I'm your son.
No shit?
I got some money I can give you -
Keep it.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
I don't believe you.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
You and Robin moved?
Where'd he come from?
But a fuckin' baggie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
Just put it in your purse.
I didn't mean -
What was the Jew-boy's name?
We want you to tell us about last night.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
Meaning...???
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
I need to go now.
What kind of information?
Change what?
You wouldn't understand.
A jail?  Prison?
What year is it?
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
Are you hurt?
James, why don't we...?
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
I thought I was in...prison again.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
They hurt you!
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
Uh, that message...me?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Nine thirty
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
That's my morning's pay.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Don't look like nothing.
How much?
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Open up!
I want my car.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
Kirin?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Taking a little trip?
What do you want?
Who was that on the phone?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I don't know your real name.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Like you.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
I can't.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
John?  John where are you going?
What are you talking about?
I wanted to talk.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Let's do it here.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
Are you all right?
No.  I swear it.
Who the hell are you?
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Like you don't know.
No.
Talk?  About what?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
And what does that make you?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
What are you babbling about?
Got any requests?
How old are you?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
You're fucked.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
Senor, you need a doctor.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
You broke my nose!
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
That's a solid name.
An overheated car.
California...
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Hey!
About things.  About your wife.
I'm not rambling.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You Harlin?
But he's dead.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
What the hell happened to my car?
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
What?
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
It's Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
I don't know how.
Try me.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Grace ... Grace?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
But I thought --
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
The old lady?
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Where to?
Out of here.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
Beck's.
Let me get your change.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Wrong number.
You didn't hear something?
Help me, Grace, help...
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
How old is Jeb?
What did I say?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
When was the last time I wore pink?
I remember you.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
What was that?
Think carefully?
Why?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Are you for real?
Like what?
Yes.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
When?
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
I'm going to go in.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
Is that right?
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Did you get up from your seat?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
How so?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Well, go get it then.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
What'd he say?
Nope.
Free ones?
You want... a free one.
Books. He's my biographer.
Mmmm pistols.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Property.
Yup.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
Duke.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
Then... what?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
N-no, sir?
Well, how about it?
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
It's gonna get riper yet.
Yup.
First one I ever killed.
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Three ways?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
HEY.
Shit.
Jesus.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Three.
Tom?
Who said that?
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Well, suppose he does?
An' if I spot 'em?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Jack. What are you doing here?
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
Why don't you just calm down'
What are we gonna do?
How are they going to do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Let's say for example -
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
What about Redfoot?
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
We're on vacation.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Waste of time.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Came from Redfoot.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
I don't.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why didn't you help him?
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
Yes.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Ed Concannon.
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
That's what I'd planned to...
...What difference would...
I.  Yes.  It is.
I read the hospital report on your client.
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
Who are you protecting, then?
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
That happens.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Why?
Maybe what?
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
I've got to work.
Is there going to be a later...?
It's over!
What is that to you...?
Joe...  Joe...
Thank you.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
Uh ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
You got a good memory, Franky.
So what?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
What did she do?
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
A single hour.
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Me, too.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Would you like a drink now?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
It's not my line.
There are things you didn't tell me.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Hello?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Just let me talk to you.
You.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
Tomorrow night? Well --
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
No.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
I like that one.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You can.
Yes.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Ernie's?
Come here.
Scottie!
How does it work?
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
What are you going to do?
Why?
I... didn't know where you lived.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
And no birds sing.
What?!
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
To the church, I must go there.
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Why?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
How long has she had the room?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Uh-huh!
Normal.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
What.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Who?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
What's that?
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
I don't know why the floor was wet!
This is pathetic.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
Later.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
No way.
I want you to hear me out.
I don't think so.
I got you.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
I just want to get married.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
The hell you didn't!
The hell I did!
Nope.
False.
Take Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
This is ridiculous.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
We missed the deadline.
Can't we do it on the phone?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Florist?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
He's quiet.
That's absurd.
Honey I don't have the time...
Take care of those chairs.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
I'm working on it.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
No way.
We're not canceling.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
You fucked a prostitute?
But...
But...
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
You're not breathing right?
Buzzing?
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
My God...
I guess.
That's a good one.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
She's dead.
Shut up Micheal.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
How long are you staying?
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
You must think I am a monster.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
She won't even know.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
So, Ramona!
She isn't my cousin.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
It's for people!
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Ask the priest, miss.
Hello.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
He was a computer program for crissake.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
I've seen worse.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Get that fucking thing away from me!
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
How do you kill it?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Where's John?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
There you go —— best seat in the house.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
...this is a snappy song....
...The Albanian Campaign...
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
We're going to have to explain away the...
What would do that...?
....we landing?
...the... 
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Why?
What did Albania ever do to us?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
...fourteen years...
He thinks it's too...
That's not bad at all.
Wilfred.
Courage, Mom.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
Quite touching.
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Hello...?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
When's he coming back...?
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
What do you think would hold it off?
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
W...what?
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
...we get our hands on him?
...that's right.
Big mistake.
Of what?
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
 A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
We're going home.  We're going home together...
I'm tired.
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
A proud tradition.
What're you doing?
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
Do it later...  Okay,  now, "The Little Girl," who is she, what is she doing?  She is....she's ...Okay, okay, it's an Albanian village... She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Please, no thanks... 
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
Speak English will ya.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
What are you doing here?
What if he asks where I got the money?
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
I don't know anything!
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Okay.
Yeah, right...
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
My home number's on the back...
...I can't even see it...
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
I guess I'll head back...
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
So. See you Friday.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Safety in numbers man.
Well?
Well divide 18 into three
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Do you have a scarf?
So much.
What?
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Why is he worried?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?
Do you?
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Who are you?
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
You're the flower lady.
Who?  Your husband?
What?  What are you afraid of?
I don't know.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Seance.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Then what was it?
If she was dangerous before--
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Claire?
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Tired?
Wanna fool around?
Why?
In the house.  I was scared.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
What am I looking at?
Dressed?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Oh.
You're not at the center.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
Yep.
I felt you...looking through me...
But I don't remember.
Not personally.
Ow!
I was there.
Claire--
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
We have to get out of here.
What?
How can you be sure?
The leaves...
Huh.
I'm cooking you dinner.
I know.
Shhhh.
What?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Then you wear it.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
What is it...?
She didn't feel them
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
uh - then he - be just -
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
HARDER!
What else did you see- Michael...?
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
Doctor's orders- - -?
I'm serious.  You don't -
God knows, I'm intriguing.
What about your work back home...?
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Their what...?
Mm-hmmm...
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
I'm getting --- left behind.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
I thought you were someone else
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
That's right...
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
It doesn't mention 'females only'
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
So what do you do?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
What?
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
Just put it in my room
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
That's good
Someday, I'll find out.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
You're late, bro!
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
From your lips, to God's ears.
But that smile.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Watch your tone, mister.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Ted! Do something!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
He was my Grandfather, too.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Don't write that part.
Funny you should say "peachy."
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Come on.
I want you to trust me.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You're quick. I like that.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
Only the best for my mother.
Like what?
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
I told you you could do it.
Really? You'd do that for me?
My parents always say hard work builds character.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
People pay good money for that?
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
How soon can we get something?
You okay?
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Eliminate the competition.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
I want a full-scale investigation.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
You didn't cuff her?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Curiosity, I guess.
You're out of your mind.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mon.
I miss Dad.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
About what?
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
The one you bought at school.
And she wanted to talk.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
But I..
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Limestone quarry?
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
What is this?  A whole new train?
He's not giving up?
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Would that include me?
This is Colonel Richards.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
The first.
Dr. Pemberton?
Well?
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
They look like acorns.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
I do what I'm told.
Smells like a battle.
You hear trouble.
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
You!!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
She's in love.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
How am I gonna do that?
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Who is he?
This is not going well.
Talk!  Say something!
Maybe milking.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Your hole is healed, then?
No pistol. Ever.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Maybe.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
They kid a lot.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Where are you taking us now?
Does anybody know I'm here?
How long have I been here?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
We had some lemonade and he left.
When will you be going?
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
You know where he is.
I admit I don't know where he is.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
Yes, thank you very much.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
Who was that man?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
This?
...didn't you?
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Oh, no -- no!
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
No --
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh! Something bit me, too!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
A home --
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
But why?  Why?
Did they hurtcha?
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Yes -- that's true.
Here -- here --
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Dorothy next!
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
What happened?
Yes, you.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
Well, I --
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
Zukovsky...
It’s just a scratch.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
He survived?
The inside man?
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Beautiful, isn’t it?
No!  It will cave in!
I can’t stay.
What are you talking about?
...what?
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
You can drop the act, it’s over.
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
So you killed your father.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
I thought you were the one in her business.
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
No!  Get me out!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
The Maiden’s Tower.
How appropriate.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter --
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Because --
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
What -- am I --
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
They're practically on us . . .
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
So do I.  So do you.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Their real names, please.
Am I free to go?
Ever see one of these before?
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Not bad for a gimp.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
What do you have?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
Are you alright?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
You okay?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
Nice hops.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
I don't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
Are you all right?
Anything else I can get you?
What do you say?
He takes himself seriously.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
What are you going to do?
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
What did she do to me?
Is that what you're looking for?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
It does indeed, Max.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Love me oodles and oodles?
MMmmm.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Yes, don't worry.
Yes.
Darling!
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
Why are you talking like that?
Wockers with the knockers???
Home!
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Was he any good?
You can't win 'em all.
You'll be getting me sad next.
Who are you talking to?
No, no!  That whole thing!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Ooh!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Raise the platform, hurry!
It wasn't me.
What are you going to do?
All right -- give it to him!
I think so.
Good night, Doctor.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Yes, I will.
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
